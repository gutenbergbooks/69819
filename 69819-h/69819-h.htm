</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a real “No. 101.” Unpublished MS.
despatches now in the Record Office of the British
Museum reveal the interesting fact that on more than
one occasion the British Government obtained important
French state secrets through an agent known
to the British ministers as “No. 101.” Who this
mysterious agent was, whether it was a man or a
woman, why and how he or she so successfully played
the part of a traitor, have not, so far as is known to the
present writer, been discovered by historians or archivists.
The references in the confidential correspondences
supply no answer to such questions. If the British
ministers knew all the truth, they kept it to themselves,
and it perished with them. Doubtless there
were good reasons for strict secrecy. But it is more
than possible that they themselves did not know, that
throughout they simply dealt with a cipher whose
secret they never penetrated. It is, however, clear
that “No. 101” was in a position to discover some of
the most intricate designs in the policy of the French
Court, and that the British Government, through its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
agents, was satisfied of the genuineness of the secrets
for which it paid handsomely.</p>

<p>On the undoubted existence of this mysterious cipher,
and the riddles that that existence suggests, the writer
has based his historical romance.</p>

<small>“<span class="smcap">No. 101</span>”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening in the January of 1745, the critical year
of Fontenoy and of the great Jacobite rising, a middle-aged
gentleman, the private secretary of a Secretary of
State, was working as usual in the room of a house in
Cleveland Row. The table at which he sat was littered
with papers, but at this precise moment he had leaned
back in his chair with a puzzled expression and his left
hand in perplexity pushed his wig awry.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary,” he muttered, “most extraordinary.”
The remark was apparently caused by an
official letter in his other hand—a letter marked “Most
Private,” which came from The Hague, and the passage
which he had just read ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>I have the honour to submit to you the following important
communication in cipher, received, through our agent at Paris,
from ‘No. 101,’</i>” etc.</p>
</div>

<p>On the table lay the cipher communication together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
with a decoded version which the secretary now studied
for the third time. In explicit language the despatch
supplied detailed information as to certain recent highly
confidential negotiations between the Jacobite party in
Paris and the French King, Louis XV., a revelation in
short of the most weighty state secrets of the French
Government.</p>

<p>“‘No. 101,’” the secretary murmured, scratching
his head, “always ‘No. 101.’ It is marvellous, incredible.
How the devil can it be done?”</p>

<p>But there was no answer to this question, save the
fact which provoked it—that closely ciphered paper
with its disquieting information so curiously and mysteriously
obtained.</p>

<p>“Ah.” He jumped up and hurriedly straightened
his wig. “Good-evening to you.”</p>

<p>The new-comer was a man of about five-and-thirty,
tall, finely built, and of a muscular physique, with a
face of considerable power. Most noticeable, perhaps,
in his appearance was his air of disciplined reserve, emphasised
in his strong mouth and chin, but almost belied
by the glow in his large, dark eyes, which looked
you through and through with a strangely watchful
innocence.</p>

<p>“There is work to be done, sir?” he asked as he
took the chair offered.</p>

<p>“Exactly. To-day we have received most gratifying
and surprising information from our friend ‘No. 101’—and
we have the promise of more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“Yes.” The brief monosyllable was spoken almost
softly, but the dark eyes gleamed, as they roamed over
the room.</p>

<p>“The communications from ‘No. 101’ have begun
again,” the secretary pursued; “that in itself is interesting.
The Secretary of State therefore desired me to
send at once for you, the most trustworthy secret agent
we have. In a very few minutes Captain Statham of
the First Foot Guards will be here—”</p>

<p>“Sent, I think, from the Low Countries at the request
of our agents at The Hague?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see you are as well informed as usual. You
are quite right. Are you,” he laughed, “ever
wrong?”</p>

<p>The spy paused. “The communications then from
‘No. 101’ concern the military operations?” was all
he said.</p>

<p>“Not yet. But,” he almost laughed, “we have a
promise they will. You know the situation. This
will be a critical year in Flanders. Great Britain and
her allies propose to make a great, an unprecedented
effort; his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland
will have the supreme command. Unhappily the
French under the Maréchal de Saxe apparently propose
to make even greater efforts. With such a general
as the Maréchal against us we cannot afford to
neglect any means, fair or foul, by which his Royal
Highness can defeat the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Then you wish me to assist ‘No. 101’ in betraying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the French plans to our army under the Duke of
Cumberland?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” the other replied; “we cannot spare
you as yet. But you have had dealings with this
mysterious cipher, and we ask you to place all your
experience at the disposal of Captain Statham.”</p>

<p>“I agree most willingly,” was the prompt answer.</p>

<p>“This curious ‘No. 101,’” continued the secretary
slowly, “you do not know personally, I believe?”</p>

<p>The other was looking at him carefully but with a
puzzled air.</p>

<p>“I ask because—because I am deeply curious.”</p>

<p>“I am as curious as yourself, sir. ‘No. 101’ is to
me simply a cipher number,—nothing more, nothing
less.”</p>

<p>“I feared so,” said the secretary. “But is it not incredible?
The information sent always proves to be
accurate, but there is never a trace of how, why, or by
whom it is obtained.”</p>

<p>“That is so. Secrecy is the condition on which
alone we get it. We pay handsomely—we obtain the
truth—and we are left in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Shall we ever discover the secret, think you?”</p>

<p>“I am sure not.” The tone was conviction itself.</p>

<p>At this moment Captain Statham was ushered in, a
typical English gentleman and officer, ruddy of countenance,
blue-eyed, frankness and courage in every line
of his handsome face and of his athletic figure.</p>

<p>“Captain Statham—Mr. George Onslow of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Secret Service—” the secretary began promptly, adding
with a laugh as the two shook hands: “Ah, I see
you have met before. I am not surprised. Mr. Onslow
knows everybody and everything worth knowing.”
He gathered up a bundle of papers. “That is
the communication from ‘No. 101’ and the covering
letter. And now, gentlemen, I will leave you to your
business.” He bowed and left the room.</p>

<p>Onslow took the chair he had vacated and for a
quarter of an hour Captain Statham and he chatted
earnestly on the position of affairs in the Low Countries,
and the war then raging from the Mediterranean
to the North Sea, on the vast efforts being made by
the French for a great campaign in the coming spring,
the military genius of the famous Maréchal de Saxe,
the Austrian and Dutch allies of Great Britain, and
the new English royal commander-in-chief who was
shortly to leave to take over the work of saving
Flanders from the arms of Louis XV. Onslow then
briefly explained what the Secret Service agents of the
Duke of Cumberland were to expect and why.</p>

<p>“Communications,” he wound up, “from this mysterious
spy and traitor, ‘No. 101,’ invariably come like
bolts from the blue. They are, of course, always in
cipher and they will reach you by the most innocent
hands—a peasant, a lackey, a tavern wench—sometimes
you will simply find them, say, under your pillow,
or in your boots. No one can tell how they get there.
But never neglect them, however strange or unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
their contents may be, for they are never wrong—never!
The genuine ones you will recognise by this
mark—” he took up the ciphered paper and put his
fingers on a sign—“two crossed daggers and the
figures 101 written in blood—you see—so”:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_dongle.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Captain Statham stared at the sign, entranced.</p>

<p>“A soldier,” Onslow remarked with his slow smile,
“can always distinguish blood from red ink—is it not
so?” Statham nodded. “Remember, then, those
crossed daggers with the figures in blood are the only
genuine mark. All others are forgeries—reject them
unhesitatingly. Let me show it you again.” He produced
from his pocket-book a paper with the design in
the corner, which, when compared with the one on the
table, corresponded exactly.</p>

<p>“I warn you,” Onslow added, “because the existence
of this ‘No. 101’ is becoming known to the French—they
suspect treachery—their Secret Service is clever
and they may attempt to deceive you. As they do not
know the countersign, though they may have guessed
at the treachery of ‘No. 101’ they cannot really hoodwink
you. Cipher papers which come in the name of
‘101’ without that remarkable signature are simply a
<i>nom de guerre</i>, of politics, of love, of anything you like,
but they are either a forgery or a trap; so put them in
the fire.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>Statham sat pondering, his eyes riveted on the
crossed daggers. “You, sir,” he began, “have had
dealings with this mysterious person. Is it a man or
a woman?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Onslow laughed gently. “Every one asks
that, every man at least. I cannot answer; no one,
indeed, can. My opinion? Well, I change it every
month. But these are the facts: It is absolutely certain
that the traitor insists on high, very high pay;
absolutely certain that he or she has access to the very
best society in Paris and at the Court, and is at home in
the most confidential circles of the King and his ministers.
We have even had documents from the private
cabinet of Louis XV. Furthermore, the traitor can
convey the information in such a way as to baffle detection.
If it is a woman she is a very remarkable
one; if it be a man he is one who controls important
women. Perhaps it is both. Such knowledge, so
peculiar, so accurate, so extensive, such skill and such
ingenuity scarcely seem to be within the powers of any
individual man or woman.”</p>

<p>“Every word you say sharpens my surprise and my
curiosity.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and every transaction you will have with the
cipher will sharpen it more and more. I have been
fifteen years in the Secret Service, but this business is
to-day as much a puzzle as it ever was, for ‘No. 101’
has taught me a very important secret, one unknown
even to the French King’s ministers, which, so jealously
guarded as it is, may never be discovered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
King’s lifetime or at all. Can you really believe that
Louis, while professing to act through his ministers,
has stealthily built up a little secret service of his own
whose work is to spy on those ministers, on his ambassadors,
generals, and their agents, to receive privately
instructions wholly different from what the King
has officially sanctioned, and frequently directly to
thwart, check, annul, and defeat by intrigue and
diplomacy the official policy of their sovereign?”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?”</p>

<p>“It is a fact,” Onslow said, emphatically. “But
the King, ‘No. 101,’ you and I and one or two others
alone know it. Let me give you a proof. To-day
officially Louis through his ministers has disavowed
the Jacobites. The ministers believe their master is
sincere; many of them regret it, but their instructions
are explicit. In truth, through those private agents I
spoke of, the King is encouraging the Jacobites in every
way and is actually thwarting the steps and the policy
which he has officially and publicly commanded.”</p>

<p>“And the ministers are ignorant of this?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. But mark you, unless the King is
very careful, some day there will come an awkward
crisis. His Majesty will be threatened with the disclosure
of this secret policy which has his royal authority,
but which gives the lie to his public policy,
equally authentic. And unless he can suppress the
first he must be shown to be doubly a royal liar—not
to dwell on the consequences to France.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“What a curious king!” Statham ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Curious!” Onslow laughed softly; “more than
curious, because no one knows the real Louis. The
world says he is an ignorant, superstitious, indolent,
extravagant, heartless dullard in a crown who has only
two passions—hunting and women. It is true; he is
the prince of hunters and the emperor of rakes. But
he is also a worker, cunning, impenetrable, obstinate,
remorseless.”</p>

<p>“But why does he play such a dangerous game?”</p>

<p>“God knows. The real Louis no man has discovered,
or woman either; he is known only to the
Almighty or the devil. But you observe what chances
this double life gives to our friend ‘No. 101.’”</p>

<p>Statham began to pace up and down. “What are
the traitor’s motives?” he demanded, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Ah, there you beat me.” Onslow rose and confronted
him. “My dear sir, a traitor’s motives may be
gold, or madness, ambition, love, jealousy, revenge,
singly or together, but above all love and revenge.”</p>

<p>Statham made an impatient gesture. “I would
give my commission,” he exclaimed, “to know the
meaning of this mystery.”</p>

<p>A sympathetic gleam lingered in Onslow’s eyes as
he calmly scrutinised the young officer. “Ah,” he
said, almost pityingly, “you begin to feel the spell of
this mystery wrapped in a number, the spell of ‘No.
101,’ the fatal spell.”</p>

<p>“Fatal?” Statham took him up sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Yes. I must warn you. Every single person who,
in his dealings with this cipher, has got near to the
heart of the truth has so far met with a violent end.
It is not pleasant, but it is a fact. And the explanation
is easy. Those who might betray the truth are removed
by accident or design, some by this method,
some by that. They pass into the silence of the grave,
perhaps just when they could have revealed what they
had discovered.” He paused, for Statham was visibly
impressed. “Really there is no danger,” he added;
“but I say as earnestly as I can, because you are
young, and life is sweet for the young, for God’s sake
stifle your curiosity, resist the spell—that fatal spell.
Take the information as it comes, and ask no questions,
push no inquiries, however tempting and easy the
path to success seems, or, as sure as I stand here, His
Majesty King George the Second will lose a promising
and gallant officer.”</p>

<p>Statham walked away and resumed his seat. “And
you, Mr. Onslow?” he demanded, looking up with the
profoundest interest.</p>

<p>“Do I practise what I preach? Well, I am a spy by
profession: to some men such a life is everything—it is,
at least, to me. But I do not conceal from myself that
if my curiosity overpowers me my hour for silence, too,
will come—the silence of the unknown grave in an unknown
land.”</p>

<p>“Then is no one ever to know?” Statham muttered
with childish petulance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Probably not. A hundred years hence the secret
that baffles you and me will baffle our successors.”</p>

<p>Statham’s heels tapped on the floor. “Perhaps,”
he pronounced, slowly, “perhaps the truth is well
worth the price that is paid for it—death and the
silence of the grave.”</p>

<p>Onslow stared at him. His eyes gleamed curiously
as if they were fixed on visions known only to the
inner mind. “Perhaps,” he repeated gravely. “But
really,” he added, with a sudden lightness, “there is
no one to persuade us it is so. Come, Captain Statham,
you have not forgotten supper, I hope, and that I propose
to introduce you to-night to the most seductive
enchantress in London?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. All day I have been hungering for
that supper. In the Low Countries we do not get suppers
presided over by ladies such as you have described
to me.”</p>

<p>“In the French army they have both the ladies and
the suppers,” Onslow replied, laughing. “And, my
dear Captain, to the victors of the spring will fall the
spoils. To-night shall be a foretaste, and if my enchantress
does not make you forget ‘No. 101,’ I despair
of the gallantry of British officers.”</p>

<p>He locked up the papers, chatting all the time, and
then the two gentlemen went out together.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>ONE-FOURTH OF A SECRET AND THREE-FOURTHS OF A
MYSTERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some minutes the pair walked in silence, as if
each was still brooding on the mysterious cipher whose
treachery to France had brought them together. But
presently Statham touched Onslow on the arm. “Tell
me,” he said, “something of this enchantress. I am
equally curious about her.”</p>

<p>“And I know very little,” Onslow replied. “Her
mother, if you believe scandal, was a famous Paris
flower girl, who was mistress in turn to half the young
rakes of the <i>noblesse</i>; her father is supposed to have
been an English gentleman. Your eyes will tell you
she is gifted with a singular beauty, which is her only
dowry. Gossip says that she makes that dowry go a
long way, for she has two passions, flowers and jewels.”</p>

<p>“And she resides in London?”</p>

<p>“She resides nowhere,” Onslow answered with his
slow smile; “she is here to-day and away to-morrow.
I have met her in Paris, in Brussels, Vienna, Rome.
She talks French as easily as she talks English, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
wherever she is her apartments are always haunted by
the men of pleasure, and by the <i>grand monde</i>. Women
you never meet there, for she is not a favourite with
her own sex, which is not surprising.”</p>

<p>“Pardon,” Statham asked, “but is she—is she, too,
in the Secret Service?”</p>

<p>“God bless my soul! No; we don’t employ ladies
with a passion for jewels. It would expose them and
us to too many temptations. And, besides, politics
are the one thing this goddess abhors. Eating, drinking,
the pleasures of the body, poetry, philosophy, romance,
the arts, and the pleasures of the mind she
adores; luxury and jewels she covets, but politics, no!
They are a forbidden topic. For me her friendship is
convenient, for the politicians are always in her company.
When will statesmen learn,” he added, “that
making love to a lady such as she is is more powerful
in unlocking the heart and unsealing the lips than
wine?” “And her name?”</p>

<p>“She has not got one. ‘Princess’ we call her and
she deserves it, for she is fit to adorn the Palace of
Versailles.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Statham, “she will some day.”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it—if Louis will only pay enough.”</p>

<p>They had reached the house. Statham noticed that
Onslow neither gave his own nor asked for his hostess’s
name. He showed the footman a card, which was returned,
and immediately they were ushered into two
handsome apartments with doors leading the one into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the other, and in the inner of the two they found some
half-dozen gentlemen talking. Three of them wore
stars and ribbons, but all unmistakably belonged to
that <i>grand monde</i> of which Onslow had spoken. From
behind the group the lady quietly walked forward and
curtsied deferentially to Statham, who felt her eyes
resting on his with no small interest as his companion
kissed her hand. The secret agent had not exaggerated.
This woman was indeed strikingly impressive.
About the middle height, with a slight but exquisitely
shaped figure, at first sight she seemed to flash on you
a vision composed of dark masses of black hair, large
and liquid blue eyes, and a dazzling skin, cream-tinted.
Dressed in a flowing robe of dark red, she wore in her
hair blood-red roses, while blood-red roses twined along
her corsage, which was cut, not without justification,
daringly open. Her bare arms, her theatrical manner,
and the profusion of jewels which glittered in the
candle-light suggested a curious vulgarity, which was
emphasised by her speech, for her English, spoken
with the ease of a native, betrayed in its accent rather
than its words evidence of low birth. Yet all this was
forgotten in the mysterious charm which clung about
her like a subtle and intoxicating perfume, and as
Statham in turn kissed her jewelled hand, a fleeting
something in her eyes, at once pathetic and vindictive,
shot with a thrill through him.</p>

<p>“An English officer and a friend of Mr. Onslow,”
she remarked, “is always amongst my most welcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
guests,” and then she turned to the elderly fop in the
star and ribbon and resumed her conversation.</p>

<p>Statham studied her carefully. Superb health, a
superb body, and a reckless disregard of convention
she certainly had, but the more he observed her the
more certain he felt that that wonderful skin as well as
those lustrous blue eyes and alluring eyebrows owed
more to art than to nature. In fact every pose of her
head, every line in her figure, the scandalous freedom
of her attire were obviously intended to puzzle as much
as to attract—and they succeeded. She was the incarnation
of a fascination and of a puzzle.</p>

<p>Two more gentlemen had arrived, and Statham was
an interested spectator of what followed.</p>

<p>“Princess,” the new-comer said, “I present to you
my very good friend the Vicomte de Nérac.”</p>

<p>The lady turned sharply. Was it the visitor’s name
or face which for the moment disturbed her equanimity?—yet
apparently neither the Vicomte nor she had met
before.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Vicomte,” she said, so swiftly recovering
herself that Statham alone noticed her surprise, if
it was surprise. “And may I ask how a Capitaine-Lieutenant
of the Chevau-légers de la Garde de la
Maison du Roi happens to be in England when his
country is at war?”</p>

<p>“You know me, Madame!” the Vicomte stammered,
looking at her in a confusion he could not conceal.</p>

<p>The lady laughed. “Every one who has been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Paris,” she retorted, “knows the Chevau-légers de la
Garde, and the most famous of their officers is Monsieur
the Vicomte de Nérac, famous, I would have these
gentlemen be aware, for his swordsmanship, for his
gallantries—and for his military exploits which won
him the Croix de St. Louis.”</p>

<p>“You do me too much honour, Madame,” the
Vicomte replied.</p>

<p>“As a woman I fear you, as a lover of gallant deeds
and as a fencer myself I adore you, as do all the ladies
whether at Versailles or in Les Halles,” she laughed
again. “But you have not answered my question.
Why are you in England, Monsieur le Vicomte?”</p>

<p>“Nine months ago I had the misfortune to be taken
prisoner, Madame, but in three weeks I return to my
duty as a soldier and a noble of France.” He bowed
to the company with that incomparable air of self-confidence
tempered by the dulcet courtesy which was the
pride of Versailles and the despair of the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>“And here,” the lady answered, “is another gentleman
who also shortly returns to his duty. Captain
Statham of the First Foot Guards, Monsieur le Vicomte
de Nérac of the Chevau-légers de la Garde. Perhaps
before long you will meet again, and this time not in a
woman’s salon.”</p>

<p>“When Captain Statham is taken prisoner,” the
Vicomte remarked, smiling, “I can assure him Paris
is not less pleasant than London, but till then he and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
must agree to cross swords in a friendly manner for the
favours of yourself, Princess.”</p>

<p>“And you think you will win, Vicomte?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible we can lose,” the Vicomte replied.
“Not even the gallantry of the First Foot Guards can
save the allies from the genius of Monseigneur the
Maréchal de Saxe.”</p>

<p>“We will see,” Statham responded gruffly.</p>

<p>“Without a doubt, sir.” The Vicomte bowed.</p>

<p>Statham stared at him stolidly. He could hardly
have guessed that this exquisitely dressed gentleman
with the slight figure and the innocently grand air was
really a soldier, and above all an officer in perhaps the
most famous cavalry regiment of all Europe, every
trooper in which, like the Vicomte himself, was a noble
of at least a hundred years’ standing, but he was reluctantly
compelled to confess that the stranger was
undeniably handsome, and his manner spoke of an ease
and a distinction beyond criticism. His smile, too, was
singularly seductive in its sweetness and strength, and
his brown eyes could glitter with marvellous and unspeakable
thoughts. From that minute he seemed to
imagine that his hostess belonged to him: he placed
himself next her at supper, he absorbed her conversation,
and, still more annoying, she willingly consented.
Statham in high dudgeon had to listen to the polite
small talk of his English neighbour, conscious all the
while that at his elbow the Vicomte was chattering
away to “the princess” in the gayest French. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
after supper he along with the others was driven off to
play cards while the pair sat in the other room alone
and babbled ceaselessly in that infernal foreign tongue.</p>

<p>“The Vicomte,” Onslow said coolly, “has made
another conquest.”</p>

<p>“It is true, then, that he is a fine swordsman as well
as a rake?”</p>

<p>“Quite true. His victims amongst the ladies are as
numerous as his victims of the sword. It is almost as
great an honour for a man to be run through by André
de Nérac as it is for a woman to succumb to his wooing.
Do not forget he is a Chevau-léger de la Garde
and a Croix de St. Louis.”</p>

<p>Statham grunted.</p>

<p>“It is not fair,” Onslow pursued, throwing down
the dice-box. “You are not enjoying yourself,” and
he rose and went into the other room. “Gentlemen,”
he said, on his return, “I have persuaded our princess
to add to our pleasure by dancing. In ten minutes she
will be at your service.”</p>

<p>The cards were instantly abandoned and while they
waited the Vicomte strolled in and walked up to
Onslow.</p>

<p>“That is a strange lady,” he remarked, “a very
strange lady. She knows Paris and all my friends as well
as I do; yet I have never so much as seen her there.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Onslow answered, looking him all over,
“she is very strange.”</p>

<p>“And the English of Madame is, I think, not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
English of the quality?” Onslow nodded. “That,
too, is curious, for her French is our French, the
French of the <i>noblesse</i>. She says her father was an
English gentleman, and her mother a Paris flower girl,
which is still more curious, for the flower girls of Paris
do not talk as we talk on the staircase Des Ambassadeurs
at Versailles, or as my mother and the women of
my race talk. Mon Dieu!” he broke off suddenly,
for the princess had tripped into the room, turning it
by the magic of her saucy costume into a flower booth
in the market of Paris, and without ado she began to
sing a gay <i>chansonnette</i>, waving gently to and fro her
basket of flowers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Quand on a su toucher</div>
<div class="verse">Le cœur d’une bergère</div>
<div class="verse">On peut bien s’assurer</div>
<div class="verse">Du plaisir de lui faire.</div>
<div class="indent">Et zon, zon, zon,</div>
<div class="verse">Lisette, ma Lisette;</div>
<div class="indent">Et zon, zon, zon,</div>
<div class="verse">Lisette, ma Lisou.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the dance into which without a word of warning
she broke was something to stir the blood of both
English and French by its invincible mixture of coquetry,
lithe grace, and audacious abandon, its swift
transitions from a mocking stateliness and a tempting
reserve to its intoxicating, almost devilish revelation of
uncontrolled passion; and all the while that heartless,
airy song twined itself into every pirouette, every pose,
and was translated into the wickedest provocation by
the twinkling flutter of her short skirt and the flashes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of the jewelled buckles in her saucy shoes. To Statham
as to André de Nérac the princess had vanished, and
all that remained was a witch in woman’s form, a witch
with black hair crowned with crimson roses and a
cream-tinted skin gleaming white against those roses
at her breast.</p>

<p>“To the victor,” she cried, picking a nosegay from
her basket, and kissing it, “to the victor of the
spring!” and André and Statham found themselves
hit in the face by the flowers. The salon rang with
“Bravos” and “Huzzas” until every one woke to the
discovery that the dancer had disappeared.</p>

<p>When she returned she was once more in her splendid
robes and frigidly cynical as before.</p>

<p>“I am tired, gentlemen,” she said; “I must beg
you to say good-night.” She held out her hand to the
Vicomte. “<i>Au revoir!</i>” she said, permitting her
eyes to study his olive-tinted cheeks and the homage
of his gaze.</p>

<p>“Your prisoner, Madame,” he said, “your prisoner
for always!”</p>

<p>“Or I yours?” she flashed back, swiftly.</p>

<p>And now she was speaking to Statham. “We shall
meet again,” she said. “Yes, we shall meet again,
Captain.”</p>

<p>“Not in London, Madame,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! But I trust our meeting will be as
pleasant for you as to-night has been for me.”</p>

<p>“It cannot fail to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Ah, you never know. Women are ever fickle and
cruel,” she answered, and once again as he kissed the
jewelled fingers Statham was conscious of that pathetic,
pantherish light in her great eyes, which made him at
once joyous, sad, and fearful.</p>

<p>When they had all gone the woman stood gazing at
her bare shoulders in the long mirror. “<i>Fi, donc!</i>”
she muttered with a shrug of disgust, and she tore in
two one of the cards with which the gamblers had been
playing, allowing the fragments to trickle carelessly
down as though the gust of passion which had moved
her was already spent. Then she drew the curtains
across the door between the two rooms, and remained
staring into space. “André Pierre Auguste Marie,
Vicomte de Nérac,” she murmured, “Seigneur des
Fleurs de Lys, Vicomte de—” she smelled one of her
roses, the fingers of her other hand tapping contemplatively
on her breast. A faint sigh crept into the
stillness of the empty, glittering room.</p>

<p>Then she flung herself on the low divan, put her
arms behind her head, and lay gazing in front of her.
The door was opening gently, but she did not stir. A
man walked in noiselessly, halted on the threshold, and
looked at her for fully two minutes. She never moved.
It was George Onslow. He walked forward and stood
beside her. She let her eyes rest on him with absolute
indifference.</p>

<p>“There is your pass,” he said, in a low voice in
which emotion vibrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“I thank you.” She made no effort to take it, but
simply turned her head as if to see him the better.</p>

<p>“Is that all my reward?” he demanded. “It was
not easy to get that pass.”</p>

<p>“No?” She pulled a rose from her breast and
sniffed it. “I believe you. I can only thank you
again.”</p>

<p>He dropped the paper into her lap, where she let it
lie.</p>

<p>“By God!” he broke out, “I wish I knew whether
you are more adorable as you are now on that sofa, or
as you were dancing in that flower girl’s costume.”</p>

<p>“Most men in London prefer the short petticoats,”
she remarked, moving the diamond buckle on her shoe
into the light, “but in Paris they have better taste, for
only a real woman can make herself adorable in this”—she
gave a little kick to indicate the long, full robe.
“Think about it, <i>mon ami</i>, and let me know to-morrow
which you really like the better.”</p>

<p>“And to-night?”</p>

<p>She stooped forward to adjust her slipper. “To-night,”
she repeated, “I must decide whether I dislike
you more as the lover of this afternoon, the man of
pleasure of this evening, or the spy of to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He put a strong hand on her shoulder. In an instant
she had sprung to her feet.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried, imperiously, “I have had enough
for one day of men who would storm a citadel by insolence.
Leave me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“You are expecting some one?”</p>

<p>“And if I am?”</p>

<p>“Don’t torture me. Tell me who it is.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will have to wait till dawn or longer
before you see him.”</p>

<p>“I will kill him, that is all,—kill him when he leaves
this house.”</p>

<p>“I have no objection to that,” was the smiling answer.
“One rake less in the world is a blessing for
all women, honest or—” she fingered her rose caressingly.</p>

<p>“Is it one of those who were here to-night!” he demanded.
“Perhaps that infernal libertine of a Vicomte
de——”</p>

<p>“Pray, what have my secrets to do with you?”
She faced him scornfully.</p>

<p>“This.” He came close to her. “You flatter
yourself, <i>ma mignonne</i>, that you guard your secrets
very well. So you do from all men but me. But I
take leave to tell you that three-fourths of those secrets
are already mine.” She sniffed at the rose in the most
provoking way. “Yes, I have discovered three-fourths,
and——”</p>

<p>“The one-fourth that remains you will never discover
until I choose.”</p>

<p>“Do not be too sure.”</p>

<p>“And then——?”</p>

<p>“You, <i>ma mignonne</i>, you the guest of many men,
will be in my power, and you will be glad to do what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
I wish. Oh, I will not be your cur, your lackey, then,
but you will——”</p>

<p>She dropped him a curtsey, and walked away to an
escritoire, from a drawer in which she took out a piece
of paper.</p>

<p>“The one-fourth that remains,” she said, holding it
up, and offering it to him, “I give it to you, my cur
and lackey.”</p>

<p>She watched him take it, unfold it, read it. His
hand shook, the paper dropped from his fingers, and
while he passed his handkerchief over his forehead she
put the fragment in the fire.</p>

<p>They faced each other in dead silence. She was
perfectly calm, but his mouth twitched and his eyes
gleamed with an unhallowed fire and with fear.</p>

<p>“Are you mad?” he asked at last, “that you confess
such a thing to me—<i>me?</i>”</p>

<p>“Better to you,” she retorted, “than to that infernal
libertine, the Vicomte de Nérac, or that infernal
simpleton, Captain Statham, eh? No, <i>mon ami</i>, my
reason is this: Now, you, George Onslow, who profess
to love me, who would make me your slave, are in
my power, and the proof is that I order you to leave
this room at once.”</p>

<p>“I shall return.”</p>

<p>“Then you certainly will be mad.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” He sprang forward. “Can you not believe
that I love you more than ever? I——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>The door had slammed. Onslow was alone.</p>

<p>For a minute he stood, clenching his hands, frustrated
passion glowing in his eyes. “Ah!” he exclaimed
in a cry of pent-up anguish, and then the door
slammed again as he strode out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A FAIR HUNTRESS AND THE GIRL WITH THE SPOTTED
COW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> months later André, Vicomte de Nérac, was
riding in the woods around Versailles, and, poverty-stricken,
debt-loaded noble as he might be, his heart
was gay, for was he not a Capitaine-Lieutenant in the
Chevau-légers de la Garde, and a Croix de St. Louis;
was he not presently about to fight again for honour
and France, and was he not once more a free man and
in his native land with Paris at his back? The leafless
trees were just beginning to bud, though winter was
still here, but the breath of spring was in the air and
the gladness of summer shone in the March sun. Yes,
the world bid fair to be kind and good, and André’s
heart beat responsive to its call. Love and honour
and France were his, and what more could a noble
wish?</p>

<p>He let the reins drop and breathed with contentment
the bracing breeze, while his eyes roamed to and fro.
Clearly he was waiting for some one who, his anxious
gaze up the road showed, might be expected to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
from that quarter—the quarter of the Palace of Versailles.</p>

<p>Along the path walked a peasant girl driving a
splendid spotted cow. The bell at its fat throat tinkled
merrily, the sun gleamed on its glossy spotted hide.
The girl dropped a curtsey to the noble gentleman sitting
there on his fine horse and himself so handsome a
cavalier, and André nodded a smiling reply. She was
not pretty, this peasant wench, with her shock of tumbled
flaxen hair tossed over her smutty face, and her
bodice and short skirt were soiled and tattered, but
André, to whom all young women were interesting, in
the sheer gaiety of his heart tossed her a coin and
smiled again his captivating smile.</p>

<p>“May Monseigneur le Duc be happy in his love!”
the wench said, as she bit the coin before she placed
it in her bodice, and André remarked with approval
the whiteness of her teeth. If her face was not pretty
her body was both trim and sturdy, and she walked
with the easy swing of perfect health. He could have
kissed her smutty face then just because the world was
so fair and he was free.</p>

<p>“You have a magnificent cow, my dear,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“But certainly,” she answered and her white teeth
sparkled through her happy laugh, “better a fat cow
for a wench than a lean husband. She carries me, does
my spotted cow, which no husband would do,” and she
scrambled on to the glossy back and laughed again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
throwing back her shock of flaxen hair. André observed,
heedful by long experience of such trifles, that
not even her clumsy sabots could spoil the dainty neatness
of her feet.</p>

<p>“And what may your name be?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yvonne, Monsieur le Duc; they call me Yvonne of
the Spotted Cow, and some,” she dimpled into a
chuckle, “Yvonne of the Spotless Ankles. I am not
pretty, <i>moi</i>, but that matters not. My fat cow or my
ankles will get me a husband some day, and till then,
like Monseigneur, I keep a gay heart.”</p>

<p>Whereupon she drove her heels into the cow’s flanks
and the two slowly passed out of sight, though the
merry tinkling of the bell continued to jingle through
the leafless trees long after she had disappeared.</p>

<p>André waited patiently. An hour went by, still he
waited. Twice he trotted up the road and peered this
way and that, but there was not a soul to be seen, and
with a muttered exclamation of disgust he was about
to spur away when the notes of a hunting horn caused
him to gather up the reins sharply. And now eager
expectation was written on every line of his face.</p>

<p>A young lady in a beautiful riding dress of hunting
green, and attended by a single lackey on horseback,
came galloping down the forest track. At sight of
him by the roadside she pulled up her horse in great
astonishment.</p>

<p>“André—you—you are back?” she said, and the
colour flooded into her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Thank God, yes.”</p>

<p>“And well?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. My wounds are healed. I am a prisoner
no longer, and in a fortnight I return to the Low
Countries to seek revenge from my enemies and yours,
Denise, the English.”</p>

<p>Her grey eyes flashed, then dropped modestly.
“You will find revenge, little doubt,” she said, “the
Maison du Roi are soldiers worthy of the <i>noblesse</i> and
of France. But do you not come to Versailles
first?”</p>

<p>“No. My company is not on duty this month at
the Palace and in April we shall all be with His Majesty
in Flanders.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “I forgot.”</p>

<p>She began to stroke her horse’s neck in some embarrassment.
André gazed at her with the hungry eyes
of a starved lover, and indeed this girl was worthy of a
soldier’s homage. Neither a brunette nor a blonde, for
her eyes were grey and their lashes almost black,
though her hair was fair and the tint of her cheeks in
the morning air delicate as the tint of a tender rose.
Beautiful, yes! but something much more than beautiful.
A great noble this lady surely, one who saw in
kings and queens no more than an equal, and in palaces
the only fit home of beauty nobly born, one to whom
centuries of command had bequeathed a tone and
quality which men and women can inherit but not
acquire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“And when I return,” André said at last, “shall
I find at Versailles what I desire more than revenge?”</p>

<p>“What is that?” she asked innocently.</p>

<p>“Can you not guess? Have you forgotten? Ah,
Denise, twelve months ago you promised——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she broke in, eagerly, “I said I would
reflect.”</p>

<p>“There is only one thing that a poor Vicomte and
a soldier of France can desire—your heart, Denise;
your love, Denise; the heart and the love of the most
beautiful and loyal woman in France, the heart of
the Marquise de Beau Séjour. And André de Nérac
loves the Marquise as he loves France. Can he say
more?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” she said, averting her eyes, “and the
Marquise de Beau Séjour thanks the Vicomte de Nérac
for his words and his homage—to France.”</p>

<p>“I do not desire thanks—I——”</p>

<p>“Then go and do your duty as a noble and a soldier,
and when peace and victory are ours perhaps I——”</p>

<p>“I cannot wait till then. Have pity, Denise, have
pity on the man who was your playmate, who loved
you then and who loves you now. Remember, remember,
I beg you, that over there in England the
one thought that consoled my prisoner’s lot was the
hope that when I returned to you—you would——”</p>

<p>“But, André, I cannot give you an answer, here,
now——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Give it me then before I return to the war, that I
may know whether I am to live in hope, or to die sword
in hand and in despair.”</p>

<p>“There is more than one marquise in the world,”
she said, quietly.</p>

<p>“Not for me.”</p>

<p>Denise looked at him, and he dropped his eyes, for
he understood the calm reproach.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, with decision. “I go to my
home to-morrow. You shall have my answer in four
days at the Château de Beau Séjour if you care enough
to come and hear it.”</p>

<p>“If—” he broke off. “Ah, Denise—!” he stretched
out a passionate hand.</p>

<p>“Hush! There is some one coming.”</p>

<p>A young man was galloping towards them, a boy he
seemed, saucy, insolent, handsome, fair, with great
blue eyes sparkling with the gayest, wickedest, most
careless joy of living. Removing his plumed hat with
an airy sweep he kissed the lady’s fingers, bowed low in
the saddle, and looked into her face:</p>

<p>“Marquise,” were his words, “the company and His
Majesty await you.” His dare-devil eyes roved on to
André’s face with a studied insouciance, but André
gave him back the look, and more.</p>

<p>Denise made haste to present the young man.
“Monsieur le Chevalier de St. Amant, secretary of the
King’s Cabinet,” she said and her eyes pleaded for
politeness from both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Monsieur le Vicomte goes to the war?” the Chevalier
asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>“As all true subjects of His Majesty ought to do,”
André retorted.</p>

<p>“Except,” said the Chevalier, bowing to Denise,
“those who find more pleasant pastime here at home.”</p>

<p>“It is curious,” André remarked, as if he had not
heard, “that I who have known Versailles for ten
years learn to-day for the first time of St. Amant.
Where is St. Amant?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” answered the Chevalier, laughing, “in this
life, Vicomte, we are always learning what is disagreeable.
The dull philosophers of whom we hear so much
in Paris at present say soldiers learn more than others—or
ought to? Perhaps you differ from them?”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi!</i> no. For when it is necessary the soldiers
teach what they have learned to the young men and
the schoolboys, which is very good for the schoolboys.
But perhaps you, sir, do not like lessons?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no! my only regret at present is that I
cannot stay now and have one at once. But Mademoiselle
la Marquise will take your place and I can
learn, as we ride together, something that she alone
can teach. Monsieur le Vicomte, I have the honour to
wish you good-morning and good-bye.” He raised
his plumed hat and galloped away with Denise.</p>

<p>The flush in André’s cheek did not die out for some
minutes. “Upstart! Puppy!” he continued to mutter
while his eyes glittered and his fingers twitched involuntarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
on the handle of his sword. But his wrath
and his scowls were suddenly dispelled in the most unexpected
and agreeable way. A crisp tinkle of bells,
the crack of a whip, and down the road came driving
an ethereal phaeton, azure blue in colour, and in it sat
an enchantress most bewitchingly clad in rose pink.</p>

<p>She too appeared to be waiting for somebody or
something, for she pulled up ten yards off and gazed in
the direction of the hunting horns which could be
heard distinctly in the depths of the wood. To André
she was most annoyingly indifferent, but the more he
looked at her and marked her exquisite dress, her
wonderful complexion, her seductive figure, and her entrancing
equipage, the keener was his chagrin. Who
was this airy sylph of the royal forest, this divinity
floating in the rose of the queen of flowers through a
leafless world as Venus might have floated on the sun-kissed
foam at dawn? Gods! What a taste in dress,
what a bust, and what amorous, saucy charm in her
eye!</p>

<p>André fell back behind the trees and watched; nor
did he have to wait long. In five minutes the royal
hunting train swept by. The rose-pink lady curtsied
to her sovereign. A cry of distress! Her hat caught
by a sudden gust—surely it was very loosely set on
that dainty head—flew off and fell almost under the
hoofs of the horse of the King of France. Majesty
looked up, coldly, caught her appealing eye, looked
down at the hat, and galloped on as if he had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
neither the hat nor its owner. The royal party behaved
exactly as did their master, and the rose-pink
goddess was left with disgust and indignation in her
face and a tear trickling down her cheek.</p>

<p>André moved his horse forward, whereupon she
threw a glance over her shoulder almost comic in its
pathos and its amusement, as if she did not know
whether to laugh or to cry; a glance which convinced
his susceptible heart that she had been perfectly well
aware of his presence all the while and now invited
him to take what she had always intended he should
have. In a second he was off his horse and was handing
her the hat. Her bow and her smile were more
than a reward, for if the rose-pink divinity was alluring
seen from behind, she was positively bewitching at
a distance of four feet in front. What wonderful eyes!
They spoke at once of everything that could stir a
soldier’s soul, and her blush was the blush of Aurora.</p>

<p>With the prettiest hesitation she inquired his name,
which he only gave on condition that she should also
tell hers. But this she laughingly refused. “My
name is nothing,” she remarked, “for I am nobody.
If you knew it you would despise yourself for having
been polite to a <i>bourgeoise</i>.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” André cried.</p>

<p>“But it is so,” she persisted, gravely, a challenge
stealing from under her demure eyelashes.</p>

<p>“I shall find out,” André said, “I shall not rest till
I find out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Then inquire,” she retorted gaily, “Rue Croix des
Petits Champs—perhaps you will succeed,” and without
more ado she flashed him a look of defiant modesty,
whipped up her ponies, and the azure phaeton vanished
as rapidly as it had appeared.</p>

<p>André stroked his chin meditatively. What did it
mean? Who was the unknown and why did she come
to the woods in that enchanting guise? A <i>bourgeoise</i>!
Pah! it would be well if all the women of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
and some of the <i>noblesse</i> possessed but one of
the secrets of her irresistible womanhood. But find
out he must, and André, hot on this new quest, began
to trot away. He was in a rare humour now, for he
had noticed with unbounded satisfaction that, while
Denise had been of the royal party, that boyish Chevalier
had not.</p>

<p>But he had not ridden far when he was amazed to
discover by the roadside Yvonne of the Spotless Ankles
weeping as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur—ah! it is the good Monseigneur—”
she fell to crying again. “They have stolen my
spotted cow,” she sobbed, “robbers have stolen my
spotted cow.”</p>

<p>“Robbers?”</p>

<p>“But yes, three great robbers, and they have beaten
me and taken Monseigneur’s piece too. My cow, my
spotted cow!”</p>

<p>“See, Yvonne,” he said soothingly, “I am no monseigneur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
I am only a poor vicomte, but you shall have
another cow, a spotted cow, too.”</p>

<p>But she would not believe it, whereupon he took all
the money in his purse, four gold pieces and three
silver ones, and thrust them into her hand.</p>

<p>She stared at the money incredulously.</p>

<p>“There, girl,” he urged, for a woman’s distress,
even though she were only a peasant, hurt him, “be
happy and buy a fat and spotted cow.”</p>

<p>She kneeled to kiss his hand. “Monseigneur,” she
sobbed, “is kind to a poor wench. Surely the good
God has sent him to me,” and she poured her hot tears
of gratitude on the ruffles of his sleeve.</p>

<p>“I am happy again,” she murmured. “Yes, I will
buy a cow and be happy,” and she began to sing,
flinging the coarse matted hair out of her eyes.</p>

<p>André watched her contentedly; it was pleasant to
see her joy.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur is not happy,” she surprised him by
saying shyly.</p>

<p>“Can the poor be happy?” he asked, absently, for
he was thinking of the goddess in pink.</p>

<p>“No,” she muttered, “not while there are robbers
in the land, and the poor are taxed till they starve.
Monseigneur is in love. Did I not see him talk with
the great lady in green?” she added suddenly. “Ah,
if Monseigneur would listen to a poor girl he too could
be happy.”</p>

<p>“Peace!” he commanded, but he was much amused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“I too was in love,” she answered, “and women
stole my lover from me as the robbers stole my cow,
and I was sick. I wasted away, but the good God
who sent me Monseigneur put it into my heart to go
to the wise woman who lives at ‘The Cock with the
Spurs of Gold’——”</p>

<p>“The Cock——?”</p>

<p>“’Tis a new tavern in the woods by the village
yonder,” she replied earnestly, “and a wise woman
lives there. For one piece of silver she brought me
back my lover. They say she is a witch, but she is no
witch, for with the help of the good God she cured my
sickness and changed my lover’s heart so that once
again he was as he had been.”</p>

<p>“Tush!” André interrupted, impatiently.</p>

<p>“But it is true,” she persisted. “And if Monseigneur
is in distress, he, too, should go to the wise woman,
and she will make him happy. It is so, it is so.”</p>

<p>“Adieu, my child, adieu!”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur will not forget. ‘The Cock with the
Spurs of Gold,’ in the woods——”</p>

<p>He gave her matted head a pat. It was a pity she
was not pretty, this wench, for she had a buxom
figure. “A soldier,” he said lightly, “does not love
wise women, Yvonne, he loves only the young and
the fair and he wins them not by sorcery, but by his
sword.”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur is a soldier?” she asked with grave
interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Yes, a soldier of France.”</p>

<p>“My lover too is a soldier, but not as Monseigneur.
Ah!” she whispered, “if all the nobles of France were
as Monseigneur there would be no unhappy women,
no robbers, and no poor.”</p>

<p>André left her there. His heart was gay again
though his purse was empty, for he had made a woman
happy. And as he rode through the woods he could
hear her singing as she had sung when he had seen
her first on the sleek back of her spotted cow. And
all the way to Paris that song of a peasant wench
softly caressed his spirit, for it clinked gaily to the
echoes of the soul as might have clinked the golden
spurs of the cock in the woods of Versailles, and it
was fresh with the eternal freshness of spring and the
immortal dreams of youth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A LOVER’S TRICK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> March sun was setting on the hamlet of La
Rivière, in the pleasant land of Touraine—Touraine
the fit home of so many noble châteaux, the cradle of
so many of the proudest traditions and the most inspiring
memories of the romance of love and chivalry
in the history of France.</p>

<p>André was standing in the churchyard of the hamlet,
but it was not at the landscape that he knew so well
that he was looking, nor even up the slope beyond,
where the great Château de Beau Séjour shot its towers
and pointed turrets through its encircling domain of
wood. Ten leagues away in the dim distance lay
Nérac, the poverty-stricken home from which he took
his title, and whose meagre patrimony encumbered
with the debts of his ancestors and his own barely
sufficed to provide a living for the widowed mother
to whom that morning he had said good-bye and
whom the English in the Low Countries might decide
he should never see again.</p>

<p>Yet it was not of his mother that he was thinking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
still less of the enchantress of the forest whose identity
he had discovered—one Mademoiselle d’Étiolles she
had proved to be, “La Petite d’Étiolles,” as that gay
Lothario the Duc de Richelieu called her, the daughter
of a Farmer-General, a <i>bourgeoisie</i> notorious for her
beauty, her wit, and her friendship with the wits. Indeed
he had forgotten the rose-pink divinity in the
azure phaeton entirely. No, he was striving to pluck
up courage to face Denise and receive her answer.
For if that answer was not what he desired it would be
better to ride straight down into the Loire and let the
last male of the House of Nérac put an end to it for
ever.</p>

<p>Twinkling lights began to shine in the great château;
its towers and gables insolent in the majesty of their
beauty, strong in the might of their antiquity, challenged
and defied him in the dusk. That was the
château of his Denise, the Marquise de Beau Séjour
whom he, gallant fool, rich only in his noble pedigree,
dared to love and hoped to win, Denise the richest
heiress in France. Yet it had not been hers so long;
its broad seignories were a thing of yesterday for her.
Fifteen years ago she, as he, had been only the child
of a vicomte as poor if as noble as himself. And
Beau Séjour lay not here, but ten leagues away, a mile
from Nérac, where that church spire hung its cross
above the horizon.</p>

<p>The soft gloom of the growing dusk imaged for
André at that moment the sombre pall of tragedy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
which twelve years ago had fallen on the great
château. An ancient house, a venerated name had
been its owner’s; were not their achievements written
in the chronicles of France? was not their origin lost
in the twilight of dim ages far, so far away? Capets
and Valois and Bourbons that house had seen coming
and going on the throne, honour and fame and
wealth and high endeavour had been theirs, and then
shame and doom, swift, unexpected, irreversible. The
story of their downfall had been his first lesson learned
in budding manhood of the harshness of the world and
the mystery of fate. Such a simple story, too. The wife
of the Marquis had run away with a lover, a baseborn
stranger gossip called him. The lover had deserted
her, why and where no one knew, and disowned
by her husband she had died miserably. Her husband,
a soldier and ambassador of the great Louis Quatorze,
had in despair or madness plunged into treason, and
had paid the traitor’s penalty on the scaffold. His
only son and heir, from remorse or consciousness of
guilt, had perished by his own hand in Poland, whither
he had gone to fight in the war. And here to-day at
his feet a rough and stained tombstone marked the
neglected grave of the only daughter who had remained.
Had she lived she would to-night have been just two
years older than Denise; had there been no treason,
she and not Denise would have been mistress of that
château now called De Beau Séjour.</p>

<p>Denise’s father for service to the state had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
awarded the lands of the traitor; the old name for
centuries noted in this soil had been annulled in infamy;
its blood was corrupted by the decree of the law, and
by the King’s will the new Marquis had carried to his
new possessions the title of his old, that Beau Séjour
yonder so near to his own Nérac. The law and the
King so far as in them lay had determined that the
very name and memory of the ancient house should be
blotted out for ever. But blot out the château they
could not. There it stood haughty as of old, to tell to
all what had once been, and the curious could still read
here and there in its storied walls the arms and emblems,
the scutcheons and shields of a family which had given
nine Marshals to France, and in whose veins royal
blood had flowed. What did that matter now? To-day
it belonged to Denise, once poor as he was, and
destined to be his bride before this sudden swoop upward
on the ruins of another to the high places of
France.</p>

<p>As André paced to and fro in the dusk the ghostly
memories thickened. Twenty years ago as a boy he
had ridden with his father to that château. He remembered
but two things, but he remembered them as
vividly as yesterday. Over the chief gateway a splendid
coat of arms had caught his boyish fancy and he
had asked what the motto “<i>Dieu Le Vengeur</i>” might
mean. “Why, father, there it is again,” he had cried,
for in the noble hall, above the famous sculptured chimney-piece,
the first thing that caught the boy’s eye was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the scroll with those three words “<i>Dieu Le Vengeur</i>.”
And the second memory was of a little girl playing
with a huge wolf-hound in the dancing firelight under
that motto, a little girl with blue eyes and fair hair,
innocent of the evil to come, playing in her hall which
had seen kings and queens for guests. “<i>Dieu Le
Vengeur</i>” she had repeated—“God will protect me,”
and they had all laughed. But had God protected her?
Here was her grave at his feet. André now recalled
his dying father’s remark five years later, when he had
heard how his neighbour the Comte de Beau Séjour
had been rewarded with the treason-tainted marquisate.
“That would have been yours, André, my son,” he
had said. And no one had understood, and he had
died before he could explain, if explain he could. That,
too, had been another bitter lesson in the cruelty of fate,
in the bleak, bitter tragedy of baffled and unfulfilled
ambitions.</p>

<p>Smitten with a sudden pity, a sharp anguish, André
kneeled in the damp, tangled grass and peered at the
tombstone which marked the humble resting-place of
the dead, worse than dead, dishonoured and infamous.
“Marie Angélique Jeanne Gabrielle ...” the
rest was eaten away. But in the church close by lay
the coffins of her ancestors, the crusaders and nobles,
and Marshals of France. The names had been obliterated.
But not even a wronged king had dared to
remove the tombs with which that church was eloquent
of the glories that had once been theirs. Yes, they lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
there of right, but she, little Marie, cradled in splendour,
who had prattled of “<i>Dieu Le Vengeur</i>,” she, the
daughter of a wanton and a traitor, lay here in the rain,
and the sheep and the goats browsed over her, and the
sabots of those once her serfs and tenants made an
insulting path over her grave. And up there another
reigned in her place.</p>

<p>A traitor! Yes, his daughter deserved her fate.
There should be no mercy for traitors.</p>

<p>“What seek you, Monsieur le Vicomte?”</p>

<p>He started at the question. It was the Chevalier de
St. Amant, boyish, insolent, though his tone was
strangely soft.</p>

<p>“I was finding a lesson,” André replied quietly.</p>

<p>“In a tombstone?”</p>

<p>André explained. The Chevalier seemed impressed,
for he went down on his knees and peered for some
minutes at the weather-beaten stone.</p>

<p>“Poor child!” he muttered. “Poor child!”</p>

<p>André was thinking the Chevalier was better than
he had supposed, but his next action jarred harshly.
Standing carelessly on the stone he gathered his cloak
about him. “Ah, well,” he remarked, with his dare-devil
lightness, “it is perhaps more fortunate for you
or me that little Marie is where she is.”</p>

<p>“For you or me?” André questioned, peering into
his young face.</p>

<p>“The Marquise awaits you, Vicomte,” he twitched
his thumb towards the château, “perhaps you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
understand better when you have seen her,” and with
a careless tip of his saucy hat he strode away.</p>

<p>For one minute André burned to seize that cloak and
speak to him very straightly. “Pah!” he muttered,
“it will do later. Perhaps it will not be necessary at
all.”</p>

<p>But it was with increased misgiving that he rode up
to the château.</p>

<p>Denise received him in the great hall, unconsciously
reproducing the picture which was burnt into André’s
memory, for she stood with a certain sweet stateliness
by the sculptured chimney-piece and a huge hound lay
at her feet. Above her head the emblazoned scutcheon
of the old house still adorned the noble carving—indeed
you could not have destroyed the one without destroying
the other—and the glad firelight which threw such
subtly entrancing shadows on the dress and girlish
figure of the young Marquise seemed to point with
tongues of flame to that sublime motto, “<i>Dieu Le
Vengeur!</i>” above her head.</p>

<p>André bowed and halted. Ambition, passion, and
hope conspired to choke him for the moment. How
fair and noble she was! yes, surpassingly fair and
noble.</p>

<p>Denise said nothing. She stared at the buckle of
her slipper.</p>

<p>“I have come for my answer,” he said, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>She met his pleading eyes fearlessly. “The answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
is, ‘No,’” she replied, and her voice, too, was low, as if
she could not trust it.</p>

<p>“No?” he repeated, half stunned.</p>

<p>She simply bowed her head.</p>

<p>“You mean it? Oh, Denise, you cannot mean it?”</p>

<p>“I have reflected and I mean it.”</p>

<p>“For always?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>André stepped nearer. “I do not remind you,
Denise,” he said, speaking with a composure won by
a mighty mastery of himself, “that I love you, that I
have loved you since I could love any woman. If you
would not believe it before I was taken prisoner, when I
spoke in the woods of Versailles, you would not believe
it now. Nor do I remind you that twelve months ago
you spoke very differently. A lover and a gentleman
does not speak of these things when the answer has
been ‘No.’ But I do ask you, before you say ‘No,’
always to remember that it was the wish of your
dead father and of mine that the answer should be
‘Yes.’”</p>

<p>“My father died five years ago, yours even longer,”
she answered.</p>

<p>“Do the years alter their wish?” he asked, with a
touch of passion, “do they make a promise, good faith,
honour, less a promise, less——”</p>

<p>“There was no promise,” she interrupted.</p>

<p>He bowed calmly. The gesture was better than
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“And your reason, Denise?”</p>

<p>“I said I would give you an answer, I did not undertake
to give reasons.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. May I plead, however, that perhaps,
remembering the past, what you and I have been to
each other since childhood, I have some right to
ask?”</p>

<p>She placed her fan on the shelf of the chimney with
sharp decision. The firelight flashed in her grey eyes.
“I refuse,” she said, very distinctly, “to marry a man
who does not love me.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not believe my words?” he questioned
quickly.</p>

<p>“You are a noble, André,” she answered; “the
courtesy of a noble and a gentleman requires that when
he demands a woman’s hand in marriage he should
profess to love her. For the honour you have done
me I thank you, but a woman finds the proof not in
words but in deeds. You are a brave soldier, but you
do not love me. That is enough.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not enough for me,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Very well.” She took a step forward. “I had no
desire to discuss things not fit for a girl to speak of to
a man who has done her the honour to ask her hand
in marriage, and I would have spared both myself and
you unnecessary pain. Plainly then and briefly, when
I take a husband I do not choose to share what he professes
is his love with any other woman. That is my
reason and my answer in one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>A flush darkened his sallow cheek. “It is not
true,” he protested passionately, “it is not true.”</p>

<p>“You would deny it?” she cried, passion too leaping
into her voice. “Is that letter to the Comtesse des
Forges, one of my friends—my friends, <i>mon Dieu!</i>—yours,
or is it not?” She handed it to him with hot
scorn.</p>

<p>“It was written twelve months ago,” he said,
somewhat lamely.</p>

<p>“And the duel which it caused is twelve months
ago, too, I suppose? The right arm of her husband
the Comte des Forges is healed, but the wound—my
God! the wound in his heart and mine, that you can
never heal. And she is not alone. Does not Paris
ring with the gallantries of the Vicomte de Nérac?
For aught I know there may be a dozen husbands in
England who have lost their sword arm because André
de Nérac professed to love their wives.” She checked
herself and was calm again. “I thank you for the
honour you have done me, but—” she offered him
the stateliest, coldest curtsey, “Vicomte, I am your
servant.”</p>

<p>She would have escaped by the door behind her, but
André intercepted her. “No,” he said, “you do not
leave me yet. I, too, have something to say and you,
Marquise, will be pleased to hear it.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met and then Denise walked back to her
place by the fireplace. She was trembling now, and
she no longer looked him in the face.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“As to the past,” he said in a low voice, “I say
nothing, for I deserve your reproaches. I have been
foolish, wicked, unworthy of you. But there is no
noble to-day at Versailles of whom the same could not
be said. Men are men, and I have never concealed
from you what I have been. But such things do not
destroy love. They cannot and they never will, and
every woman knows it. My past, I assert, is not your
reason.”</p>

<p>“What then is?” she asked proudly.</p>

<p>“I am poor, you are rich, but that is not the reason,
either. Do not think I would dishonour you
by supposing that I believed that, though some
whom you call your friends say it is. No, the
reason is that while I have been away, a prisoner,
defenceless, silent, some one—” he paused, “some one
has been poisoning your mind, some one who hopes to
take the place——”</p>

<p>“Take care——” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“You speak of the gossip of Paris. I will not tell
you what the gossip of Paris and Versailles says, for
you will hear it and more fitly from other lips than
mine. But I say, that poisoner will answer to me.”</p>

<p>She was about to speak, but checked herself.</p>

<p>“And I will tell you why. First because I love you
and I love no one else. You do not believe it. You
ask for deeds, not words. In the future you shall have
them. And second, because you, Denise, love me, yes,
love me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Have done, have done with this mockery!” she
cried.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” was his answer, “on your word of
honour, that it is not so, tell me that you do not love
me and never will, tell me that you love another and
on my word as a gentleman I will never speak of love
to you again.”</p>

<p>Dead silence. André waited quietly.</p>

<p>“I refuse,” she said, slowly, picking the words, “to
be questioned in this manner. But as you insist, I repeat—I
do not love you.”</p>

<p>André bowed. “One word more, Denise, if you
please,” he said, “one word and I leave your presence
for ever.”</p>

<p>She drew herself up. “Yes,” she said, “leave me
for ever.” But for all that she, as he, seemed spellbound
to the spot.</p>

<p>André deliberately drew from his pocket the letter
that she had thrown in his teeth and faced her.
“Thank you,” he said, very calmly. “Now that I
know you mean what you said, I, too, know what I
must do.” He walked away.</p>

<p>“Give me that letter,” she said with a swift flash of
command. “It belongs to me.”</p>

<p>“Pardon,” he answered, quietly, “yesterday the
Comte des Forges was killed by a friend of his whose
honour he had betrayed. The letter belongs to the
lady to whom it was written, the lady who will be the
Vicomtesse de Nérac.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>A faint cry escaped from Denise’s lips. For the
moment she leaned faint against the chimney-piece,
white and sick.</p>

<p>André looked at her, but he made no effort to offer
her either sympathy or help. Then he walked back,
Denise watching him, and flung the letter into the fire.
Denise started, but she said nothing, though her great
grey eyes were eloquent with half a dozen questions.</p>

<p>“The letter has served its purpose,” André said.
“Adieu, Marquise!”</p>

<p>“What does this—this trickery mean?” she demanded,
hotly.</p>

<p>“You must forgive one who loves you,” was the
calm reply, “for love laughs at tricks. The Comte
des Forges is alive and well: he has a wound in his
shoulder which is only a scratch, for the poor Comte is
always believing that some one is betraying his honour
and Madame the Comtesse has a fickle heart. Yesterday
I was his second, so I know.”</p>

<p>“Then—then—” she cried and stopped.</p>

<p>André bowed most courteously. “You refused to
believe me, Mademoiselle: I returned the compliment
and refused to believe you—and I proved it by a lover’s
trick, if you choose to call it such. That is all, but it
is enough.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” She crumpled up the fan in speechless indignation.</p>

<p>“No, Denise,” he said softly. “I shall not trouble
you now or soon, but—” he had caught her hand—“you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
shall yet be mine, I swear it. You think you do
not love me, but you shall be convinced—you shall.”</p>

<p>He kissed her fingers with a tender reverence.
“Adieu, Marquise! I go to my duty and revenge,”
he said, and he left her there under the spell of his
mastery, with her boar-hound at her feet, and the
flames of fire pointing to the motto “<i>Dieu Le Vengeur!</i>”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE PRESUMPTION OF A BEARDLESS CHEVALIER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">André</span> rode at a walking pace down the slope to the
village, for he wanted to think. He had always prided
himself on his knowledge of women; he had imagined
he knew Denise as well as himself. She was of his
class, lovely, high-spirited, proud, patriotic, and best
of all a true woman. Hence it was a sore and surprising
blow to his pride to discover that she should
reject his love because he had lived the life of his and
her class. He had gone to the château to confess
everything, to swear that from this day onwards no
other woman, be she beautiful as the dawn, as enchanting
as Circe, could ever occupy five minutes of his
thoughts. And he meant it. Those others, the shattered
idols of a vanished past, had simply satisfied
vanity, ambition, a physical craving. But Denise he
really loved. She inspired a devotion, a passion which
gripped and satisfied body, soul, and spirit; she was
that without which life seemed unmeaning, empty,
poor, despicable. But why could not she see this—the
difference between a fleeting desire and the sincere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
homage of manhood to an ideal, between the gallant
and the lover? What more had a wife a right to expect
than the love of a husband, brave, loyal, faithful?
It was unreasonable, for men were men and women
were women. Yet here was a woman who did.</p>

<p>But he would—must—win her. That was the adamantine
resolution in his breast, all the stronger because
she had scorned and defied him. Yet he would
win her in his way, not hers. Yes, he would conquer
her against herself. For him life now meant simply
Denise—the heart and the soul and the spirit of Denise—the
conquest of a woman’s will. The hot pulses of
health and strength, of manhood, his noble blood and
ambition throbbed responsive to the resolution. He
thanked God that he was young and a soldier, that
there was war and a prize to be won. Yet he also felt
that this love meant something new, that it had transformed
him into something that he had never dreamed
of as possible. And victory would complete the change.
So as he rode the fierce thoughts tumbled over each
other in a foam of passion, in the sublime intoxication
of a vision of a new heaven and a new earth—from
which he was rudely awakened.</p>

<p>He had halted for the moment at the door of the
village inn. In the dingy parlour sat the Chevalier,
one leg thrown over the table, a beaker in his hand
resting on his thigh, while his other hand was stroking
the chin of the waiting wench, a strapping, tawdry
slut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>André kicked the door open. “Am I disturbing
you?” he said, pitching his hat off as if the parlour
were his own.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” the Chevalier replied without
stirring, though the girl began to giggle with an affectation
of alarmed modesty. “My wine is just done”;
he drained off the glass. “I will leave Toinette to
you, Vicomte, for,” he put on his hat, “it is time I
returned to the château.”</p>

<p>This studied insolence was exactly what André required.
“I thank you,” he said, freezingly, “but
before I take your place, you and I, Monsieur le Chevalier,
will have a word first.”</p>

<p>“As you please, my dear Vicomte,” said the young
man, swinging comfortably on to the table and peering
at him from under his saucy plumes. “You will have
much to say, I doubt not, for you must have said so
little at the château. Run away, my child,” he added
to the wench, who was now staring at them both with
genuine alarm in her coarse eyes, “run away.”</p>

<p>André closed the door. “You will not return to the
château,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“My dear Vicomte, you suffer from the strangest hallucinations,
stupid phantoms of the mind, if you——”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” was the cold reply, “but the point of a
sword is a reality which exorcises any and every
phantom.”</p>

<p>The Chevalier laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” André continued, “I say it with infinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
regret, because you are young, you will not return to
the château, for I am going to kill you, unless——”</p>

<p>“Unless?” The Chevalier slowly swung off the
table.</p>

<p>“Unless you will give me your word of honour now
that you will leave France to-morrow and never return.”</p>

<p>The young man reflectively put back one of his
dainty love curls. “Ah, my dear Vicomte,” he answered,
“I say it too with infinite regret, but that I
cannot promise. So you must kill me I fear. Alas!”
he added with dilatory derision, “alas! what have I
done?”</p>

<p>“Very good”—André fastened his cloak—“in three
days we will meet in Paris.”</p>

<p>“In Paris? Why not kill me here?”</p>

<p>“Here?” André stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Here and at once.” He walked to the door.
“Two torches,” he called, “two torches.”</p>

<p>When he had lit them the Chevalier marched out.
“This way,” he said politely; “permit me to show
you, with infinite regret, where you can kill me.”</p>

<p>Half expecting a trick or foul play André followed
him cautiously until he stopped in a deserted stable
yard, paved and clean, and completely shut in by high
walls. The young man gravely placed one torch in a
ring on the north wall and the other on the wall
opposite.</p>

<p>“That,” he said, in the pleasantest manner possible,
“will make the lights fair. You”—he pointed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
west—“will stand there, or here, if you prefer, to the
east. You will agree, doubtless, that to a man who is
to be killed it is a trifle where he stands.”</p>

<p>The torches flared smokily in the April dusk. He
was mad, this boyish fool, stark, raving mad. But
how prettily and elegantly he played the part.</p>

<p>“See,” the Chevalier said lightly, “there is no one
to interrupt—the murder. Toinette knows neither my
name nor yours; she will hold her tongue for money
and in half an hour you will be gone—and I”—he
shrugged his shoulders—“well, it is clean lying here,
cleaner, anyway, than under the grass in that dirty
churchyard.”</p>

<p>“You mean it?” André asked slowly.</p>

<p>The Chevalier took off his saucy hat and fine coat,
hung them upon one of the rusty rings in the wall,
and turned back his lace ruffles. A flash—his sword
had cut a rainbow through the dusk across the yellow
flare of the torches. “I am at your service, Vicomte,”
he said with a low bow. “And I shall return to the
château when and how I please, and I shall be welcome,
eh?”</p>

<p>“By God!” André ripped out. “By God! I will
kill you.”</p>

<p>He too had flung off his coat and cloak and took the
position by the east wall. A strange duel this, assuredly
not the first in which the Vicomte de Nérac
had fought for a woman’s sake, but the strangest,
maddest that man’s wit or a boy’s folly could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
devised. André was as cold as ice now, and he calmly
surveyed his opponent as he tried the steel of his blade.
How young and supple and insolently gay the beardless
popinjay was; but he had the fencer’s figure, and
the handling of his weapon revealed to the trained eye
that this would be no affair of six passes and a <i>coup de
maître</i>. Yet never did André feel so calmly confident
of his own famed skill and rich experience. No, he
would not kill him, but he would teach him a lesson
that he would not forget.</p>

<p>For a brief minute both scanned the ground carefully,
testing it with their feet, and marking the falling
of the lights from those smoking torches, the flickering
of the shadows in the raw chill of eve. All around
was deathly still. Not so much as the cluck of a hen
to break the misty silence.</p>

<p>“On guard!”</p>

<p>The Chevalier was about eight paces off. He now
came slowly forward, eagerly watching for the right
moment to engage. A swift movement as of a strong
spring unbound—a flash—and steel clashed on steel.
Yes, the young man could fence. The true swordsman’s
wrist could be felt in his blade, the swordsman’s
eye in his point, and his passes came with the ease of
that mastery of style, swiftness, and precision that the
fencer can feel but not describe. For a couple of minutes
both played with the greatest caution, for they
were both in the deadliest earnest. True, this was
idle flummery at present; each had still to know the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
ground, to learn the secrets of those cruelly baffling
lights, to get the measure of the other’s powers. A
false step, a misjudged lunge, a gust of wind, a foolish
contempt might mean death. And for one, at least,
the issue was Denise.</p>

<p>So André, who had always relied on his fire and
quickness to disconcert, flurry, and tempt, kept himself
sternly in hand, offering no openings and disregarding
all. The moment would come presently, the
divine moment, and then!</p>

<p>They were both shifting ground slowly, and in their
caution they gradually edged and wheeled until the
Chevalier almost stood where André had started.</p>

<p>“Bah!” the young man cried, “this is tedious,”
and he suddenly changed his tactics. He was now
attacking with a fiery swiftness which made André’s
blood warm, and stirred his admiration, but he noted
with joy how reckless his opponent was growing.
Twice the lad only saved himself by the most dexterous
reversing of his lunges.</p>

<p>“Fool!” André muttered to himself, “that is not
the game to play with me; in three minutes he will be
mine,” and he, too, began to press his attack. Ah!—ah!—only
by the swiftest convolutions of that supple
body had the Chevalier saved himself. André began
to nerve himself for a final assault. Should he give him
the point in his sword arm—his shoulder, or his lungs?
And then the torch light flared right into his face.</p>

<p>In a second he saw what it all meant. By those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
superb reversed lunges he had been lured on till he
had been manœuvred into a place where both torches
fell in his eyes and that young devil had the lights behind
him. He—he, André de Nérac, had been outplayed
by this beardless youth! And now he was in a
corner of this damned court-yard with the cursed flicker
from the walls making lightning on the crossed steel.
“<i>Diable!</i>” he growled, “you would!” and he flung
himself on his opponent in the madness of despair and
wrath. It was now almost a <i>mêlée corps à corps</i>, but
the Chevalier would not give way. He had penned
André to the place he desired and he meant to keep
him there.</p>

<p>“<i>Holà! Je touche!</i>” he cried.</p>

<p>How had it happened? One of the torches had gone
out in a puff of air, André’s sword was on the stones
and the Chevalier had his foot on it. By an infernal
Italian trick he had dropped on one knee, the lunge
that should have gone through his heart had passed
over his head and by some superhuman secret he had
twisted the weapon from his opponent’s grasp. Yes,
André had lost Denise and death was upon him.</p>

<p>With a quick gesture the Chevalier pitched the sword
over the wall and stood sword in hand facing the defenceless
André. The breeze stirred his dainty love
locks.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte,” he said cheerfully, “will
perhaps permit me now to return to the château. I
have had my lesson.” André clenched his fists sullenly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
“Toinette,” the young man called, dropping his
point, “Toinette, bring another torch, and assist Monsieur
le Vicomte with his coat. You are a good wench,
Toinette, and a discreet, is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Curse your Italian tricks,” André growled, “curse
you and your Italian tricks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a trick, learned in Italy from a great
master in the art. But all is fair in war—and in love!
I did not wish to be killed and you are too good a
swordsman for any one to beat in half an hour, and that
is all I had. Come, Vicomte, we have had our little
encounter. Can we not be friends?” He offered his
hand.</p>

<p>André stared sulkily, yet feeling somewhat ashamed.</p>

<p>“I am not going to the château,” the Chevalier
added quietly. “I, too, am going to the war with my
master and yours, the King. If it will satisfy you, I
will promise not to speak to Mademoiselle the Marquise
de Beau Séjour until we both return.”</p>

<p>“You can do as you please with regard to Mademoiselle
la Marquise,” André said sharply.</p>

<p>“And will you do me a favour?” the young man
pleaded. “I beg you that for the future you will not
speak of our meeting here to any one.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Simply because I regret now that I prevented myself
from being killed by a low trick. Life to the young is
sweet—it is my sole excuse to a better swordsman than
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Very well,” André answered, touched to the quick
by the faultless delicacy with which the compliment
was paid.</p>

<p>“I thank you. Perhaps now you will give me your
hand?”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure.”</p>

<p>The Chevalier had for the moment stormed his heart
with the same superb grace that he had robbed him of
his sword.</p>

<p>“Adieu!”</p>

<p>And then in the sorest dudgeon André strode out in
search of his sword. To his surprise the wall of the
court where they had fought backed on to the churchyard,
and a few minutes’ groping revealed his sword by
the strangest accident lying in the damp, matted grass
that sprawled over the tombstone of the little Marquise
Marie. Yes, at that bitter moment he could
have shed tears of shame as he recalled the defeat and
the humiliation inflicted on him by that beardless boy,
on him, a Capitaine-Lieutenant of the Chevau-légers de
la Garde, on him who had never been vanquished yet.
And he had sworn to win Denise! Why was he not
lying under the sod, forgotten and dead to the pain of
the world, like little Marie?</p>

<p>A figure was creeping past him in the dark—a
woman!</p>

<p>“Who is that?” he cried sharply, plucking at her
hood.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur, it is me—me, Monseigneur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Yvonne!” He let the hood go as if he had been
stabbed.</p>

<p>“But yes, Monseigneur, Yvonne of the Spotted
Cow.” She kissed his hand, humbly.</p>

<p>“Yvonne,” he gasped. “What do you here?”</p>

<p>“I was born in this village,” she answered, “my
mother, she lives here. She is old, my mother.”</p>

<p>“You—born here?”</p>

<p>“Surely, Monseigneur. It is the truth.”</p>

<p>André shivered. Half an hour ago how near his
mother, who was old too, had been to praying for the
soul of her only son. And she had been spared that
pain by the courtesy of a beardless chevalier.</p>

<p>“And what do you now in the churchyard?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I come to say my prayers for the little Marquise
Marie. She is in the bosom of the good God, is our
little Marquise, but I say a prayer for her soul when I
am happy.”</p>

<p>“And why do you pray for the Marquise Marie?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Because surely she is our Marquise. That other”—she
waved a hand at the twinkling lights of the noble
château—“the King gave to us, but there is only one
Marquise for us here, the little lady Marie, who is dead.
<i>Dieu Le Vengeur! Dieu Le Vengeur!</i>” she whispered
softly below her breath.</p>

<p>“Peace, girl, peace,” he said, half sadly, half
angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Monseigneur,” Yvonne whispered, “Monseigneur
loves the Marquise Denise——”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” he demanded so fiercely that
Yvonne shrank back.</p>

<p>“It was the wise woman,” she answered, “the wise
woman of ‘The Cock with the Spurs of Gold,’ who
knows everything. Ah! if Monseigneur would go to
the wise woman she would tell him how he might win
the Marquise Denise. Did she not give me back my
lover, did she not tell me where to find again my
spotted cow, did she not tell me that Monseigneur
would be here to-day?”</p>

<p>“She told you that?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monseigneur.”</p>

<p>André sat down on the tombstone in the supremest
amazement and confusion. What did it, could it mean?</p>

<p>“I will pray,” Yvonne went on in her innocent, soft
voice, “to our little Marquise that Monseigneur may
marry the Marquise Denise.”</p>

<p>“Why?” André asked.</p>

<p>“Because then Monseigneur will be our lord and we
will be his serfs.”</p>

<p>“You would like to be my serf, Yvonne?” he demanded,
putting his hand on her shoulder, and he
could feel her tremble.</p>

<p>“Surely, surely,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Then you shall—some day you shall, I swear it.”</p>

<p>A gust of hot passion swept over him. She was not
pretty, this peasant wench, but she had a noble figure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and the comfort of a woman’s caress in that hour of
abasement appealed with an irresistible sweetness to
his wounded spirit. Something, however, checked his
arm that was about to slip round her—as if Yvonne
herself by a mysterious power paralysed his passion.
Yet she made no effort to escape, and under his hand
on her plump shoulder he could feel that she, too, was
in the grip of strong emotion.</p>

<p>His arm dropped to his side.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur will go to the wise soothsayer,” she
said very quietly, “for she can help him better than
any peasant wench.”</p>

<p>And then André laughed. The gaiety of yesterday
had suddenly remastered him. He forgot the shamed
sword, the Chevalier, and that infernal court with its
smoking torches. Denise should yet be his, and this
strange girl his serf.</p>

<p>“Why, then, I will seek this wise woman,” he answered
lightly, “before I go to the war. I promise,
Yvonne.”</p>

<p>And so he left her to her prayers at the tomb of the
child who should have been her lord. But she did not
pray very long. Indeed, had André cared he might
have seen her wrapped in her coarse cloak walking
swiftly towards the twinkling lights of the great château,
and she sang as she had sung on the back of her
spotted cow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE WISE WOMAN OF “THE COCK WITH THE SPURS
OF GOLD”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a strangely superstitious age this age of
Louis XV., strangely superstitious and strangely
enlightened. On the one side the illuminated philosophers
of the rising school of Voltaire, on the other a
society ready to be gulled by every charlatan, quack,
or sorceress clever enough to exploit the depths of
human credulity. You shall read in the fascinating
memoirs of that century how the male and female adventurers
tricked to their immense profit that polished,
gallant, cynical, and light-hearted <i>noblesse</i> which made
the glory of the Court. And André was a true child
of his age. Yvonne’s mystifying remarks had stirred
all the superstition and awe lurking behind his hollow
homage to the established religion, and human curiosity
whetted this stimulus of superstition. He scented, in
fact, an agreeable adventure in a visit to this mysterious
witch.</p>

<p>But first he consulted his friend Henri, Comte de St.
Benôit, like himself a Chevau-léger de la Garde, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
like himself notorious for his skill with the sword and
for his countless gallantries. Was it not St. Benôit who
had taken his place in rousing the jealousy of the
Comte des Forges and who had also been obliged to
give the hot-headed husband the quietus of a flesh-wound?</p>

<p>Henri of course knew all about the wise woman.
Was she not the talk of the <i>bel monde</i>?</p>

<p>“She won’t see you,” he said. “She only prophesies
to women, and very few of them. I tried to bring her
to book, but her girl, a devilish saucy grisette with a
roving eye and a skittish pout, shut the door in my
face, by Madame’s orders, if you please.”</p>

<p>“And you went away?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I put my knee against the door and
said that as I couldn’t pay Madame I must pay her.
Not the first time the hussy has been kissed, and it
won’t be the last. You, too, will discover the jade
hasn’t the dislike to men that her mistress has.”</p>

<p>“What will you wager she will not see me—the
mistress?”</p>

<p>“A kiss from my Diane of the ballet. I’ll bet, too,
Madame is not at home at all, for she comes and goes
like a will-o’-the-wisp. But if you do see her she’ll
tell you something cursedly disagreeable. She frightened
the poor Des Forges, your Comtesse and mine,
into hysterics, and,” his voice dropped, “she warned
the Duchesse de Châteauroux she had only three weeks
to live—and it was all the poor thing had. Don’t go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
to her, my dear André; she’ll see you in her crystal
globe, face upwards in a heap of dead with an English
sword in your guts.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, perhaps, that afternoon saw André
at the tavern called “The Cock with the Spurs of Gold,”
which, save for a brand-new sign-board, had all the
appearance of a farmhouse hastily turned into an inn.
Buried in the woods between Paris and Versailles it
was exactly suited for a rendezvous to which all might
repair without the world being any the wiser. André
had carefully disguised himself, and as he rapped on
the door his appearance suggested rather the comfortable
<i>bourgeois</i> than the noble Capitaine-Lieutenant des
Chevau-légers de la Garde. To his surprise he won
his wager with greater ease than he had dreamed.</p>

<p>The saucy grisette, whose demure demeanour could
not conceal the shifty falseness of her roving eyes, took
to her mistress the name he gave, the “Sieur de Coutances,”
and then, to his joy, speedily ushered him with
no little ogling into an empty, low-beamed parlour,
which was simply the apartment of a woman who
could indulge her love of luxury. Of the sorceress
trade there were no traces unless you counted for such
an enormous black cat with the most ferocious whiskers,
who arched his back on André’s entrance and glared
at him with diabolical yellow eyes—a cat to make the
flesh creep and bristle as did his whiskers.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Vicomte, welcome!”</p>

<p>André found himself staring in the dim light with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
intense surprise, not at a wizened hag, but at a young
woman scarcely more than five-and-twenty, dressed in
flowing coal-black draperies which made her wealth of
fair hair, blue eyes, and dazzling skin all the more
startling. Her dress was wide open at the throat and
on her breast flashed an exquisite diamond cross. And
what a figure! Those flowing draperies, that step forward
revealed a woman perfectly shaped in every limb.
It was therefore a shame that above her upper lip there
was the suggestion of a dark moustache, though it
added in the most extraordinary way to the weird effect
of her appearance.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Vicomte, welcome!” she repeated, but
she offered him no salute save a wave of her finely
shaped hand towards a chair.</p>

<p>“I am not a vicomte,” André answered doggedly.</p>

<p>“Then when did the Vicomte de Nérac lose his
rank?” she asked quickly, and laughed at his obvious
embarrassment. “Ah, Vicomte, if I were not able to
divine who my visitors were I should not have a trinket
like this—” she patted her diamond cross, stooped and
lifted the huge cat and stroked it gently with her chin.</p>

<p>“And what can I do for you?” she demanded, coming
closer.</p>

<p>“My faith, but I do not know,” he answered. The
faint perfume of her person was puzzling him sorely.
But in truth he was familiar with the perfume of so
many women that it was hopeless to expect an answer
to the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Nor do I,” the woman answered, still laughing,
and her laugh was like the purr of her cat. “In any
case, Monsieur le Vicomte must wait. A lady is
already here to see me. No, it is not necessary to
retire. In spite of that I have said, you doubt my
powers; therefore you shall listen while she and I
talk.”</p>

<p>She pointed to a large screen and André, now burning
with curiosity, gladly seated himself behind it.
The woman with the cat still in her arms promptly
flung herself on to a long sofa and rang her hand-bell.</p>

<p>“Introduce Madame,” she said to the girl, “Madame’s
<i>fille de chambre</i> must wait without.”</p>

<p>The visitor, André decided, was young. Her trim
figure, the coquettish pose of her head, the graceful
dignity of her carriage filled him with the liveliest regret
that he could not see her face, which was thickly
veiled. She came to an abrupt halt in the centre of
the room—for the woman on the sofa never stirred.
Clearly she, too, had expected something very different.</p>

<p>“Your name, Madame?” asked the sorceress
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, if it please you,” the visitor corrected,
“Mademoiselle Lucie Marie Villefranche.”</p>

<p>André was listening now with all his ears. Where
before had he heard that crisp, alluring voice?</p>

<p>“<i>Bien</i>, Madame.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle—” persisted the visitor, nettled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Then why does Mademoiselle wear a wedding-ring?”</p>

<p>The visitor made an impatient movement, bit her lip,
and petulantly drew off her glove. On the hand she
triumphantly held out there was no sign of a wedding-ring.</p>

<p>“It is in Madame’s pocket,” the sorceress said
calmly. “But it is of as little importance as is
Madame’s husband to her.”</p>

<p>The visitor checked an indignant reply and simply
glared through her veil.</p>

<p>Excellent fun, thought André, when you set one
woman against another—and such women!</p>

<p>“Give me your hand,” the sorceress proceeded, and
she inspected it with the greatest care, the owner
watching her with ill-concealed anxiety. “I see a
crown in the palm which I cannot understand,” she
said slowly, “a crown reversed. A beautiful hand,”
she murmured, “beautiful and strong. The hand of
a <i>morceau de roi</i>.”</p>

<p>Madame Villefranche uttered a sharp cry, almost of
triumph. “<i>Morceau de roi</i>,” she repeated. “<i>Morceau
de roi</i>. That is strange. You have heard perhaps that
long ago another soothsayer also said the same.”</p>

<p>“I must consult the orb,” the other replied as if she
did not hear, and she gazed long and silently at the
crystal circle which she produced from its resting-place
beside the diamond cross. “Yes, it is quite clear
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“What do you see?” was the eager question.</p>

<p>“A great gallery—it is I think the Salon d’Hercule
at Versailles—there are many men and women in it,
finely dressed—I see a lady in a rose-coloured satin in
their centre—it is her favourite colour—they pay court
to her——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Madame Villefranche had stood up. Her
hand went involuntarily to her heart.</p>

<p>“One enters with his hat on”—the sorceress jerked
out slowly—“he keeps it on—he advances as they bow—he
takes his hat off—it is the King—he kisses the
hand of the woman in rose-coloured satin—she
salutes——”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” Madame Villefranche suddenly
kneeled beside her. André, as excited as she was,
crawled forward so as not to lose a word.</p>

<p>“I see her again”—the woman proceeded after a
pause—“she gives orders to ministers—she makes
generals—she tramples on all who oppose her—the
King is her slave—ah! the crystal is disturbed—no—no—there
is much unhappiness—the land is poor—there
are jealousies, strifes, quarrels, wars—starving
men and women cry out against the King and his mistress—but
the woman in the rose-coloured satin still
wears her jewels—she does not hear them. What is
this?—yes, it is—a hearse leaving Versailles for Paris—the
King looks out of the window above on to the
Place d’Armes—he shrugs his shoulders—I do not see
the woman in the rose-coloured satin any more—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
think surely she is dead and no one cares—ah! the
crystal has become dim.” She put it down and closed
her eyes.</p>

<p>Dead silence, but André could hear the deep-drawn
breaths of Madame Villefranche. Her hands were
twisted in supreme emotion.</p>

<p>“And the face—the face of the woman, did you see
that?” she asked with dry lips.</p>

<p>The sorceress opened her eyes. “Oh, yes,” she said
slowly. “It is the face of Madame d’Étiolles, born
Jeanne Antoinette Poisson—your face, Madame,” she
added as she flung her visitor’s veil swiftly back. The
cat leaped from her arms. Madame Villefranche
sprang to her feet; the two women were confronting
each other, each drawn to her full height.</p>

<p>André too had risen. Ha! At last he understood.
The visitor was no other than the fair huntress of the
woods who had driven to see the King, in an azure
phaeton, herself clad in rose-coloured satin.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Madame d’Étiolles, stretching
her arms. “Ah!” Then she turned on the sorceress
furiously. “My woman has betrayed me,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Madame”—she curtsied as to a queen—“not
your woman but the crystal and yourself.”</p>

<p>The other threw up her head incredulously. “If
you reveal,” she said harshly, “that I have visited
you——”</p>

<p>“I never reveal who my visitors are,” was the quiet
answer, “they always reveal themselves.” She sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
down indolently, but there was almost insolent provocation
in the simple grace of the movement.</p>

<p>Madame d’Étiolles turned away. “And your pay?”
she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“As Madame pleases,” came the indifferent answer
from the sofa.</p>

<p>The visitor placed five pieces on the table, replaced
her veil, and walked towards the door. “Adieu!” she
said over her shoulder, but André could see she stepped
as one intoxicated by a sublime vision.</p>

<p>“And will Madame remember the wise woman,” the
sorceress pleaded in her soft voice, “if the crystal be
found to speak the truth?”</p>

<p>“Yes”; she had wheeled sharply, a merciless freezing
vengeance glistened in her eyes and steeled her
voice. “I will have you burned for an insolent witch.
I promise not to forget.”</p>

<p>“My thanks, Madame.” She rang the hand-bell,
and Madame was unceremoniously ushered out. The
sorceress sat reflecting and then placed the crystal in
her bosom and took away the screen.</p>

<p>“It is the turn of Monsieur le Vicomte,” she remarked
pleasantly. “It is a pity I did not ask the
lady to stay and hear.”</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” André answered. “I am
satisfied, and so was she.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur is not as Madame,” the sorceress said,
fixing a penetrating gaze on him, “he fears his
fate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“Oh, no,” was the quick reply. “My fate lies in
my sword and my head. I am ready to face it without
fear or reproach when and as it comes. But I will not
know beforehand, not even for a crown reversed.”</p>

<p>For a brief second her eyes rested on him with approval,
and indeed he looked very handsome and noble
at that moment.</p>

<p>“But Monsieur will permit me,” she said gently,
and before he could refuse she had taken his hand, “I
will not speak unless he wishes.”</p>

<p>While she studied it he studied her. What a subtle
pathos seemed to lie in those blue eyes, those smiling
lips, that dainty head almost touching him, a pathos
like her perfume ascending into the brain. And how
enchanting was that diamond cross rising and falling
on that dazzling breast.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, for she had dropped his
hand with a faint sigh, and sat staring mysteriously at
something far away.</p>

<p>“I am forbidden to speak,” she answered, averting
her eyes, and she picked up her cat, and walked away.</p>

<p>“You <i>shall</i> tell me,” André said impetuously.</p>

<p>But she only laughed over the cat’s body, stroking
it softly with her chin till its purr echoed through the
room.</p>

<p>“Confess, confess,” he said, “I <i>will</i> know.”</p>

<p>“The hand of Monsieur le Vicomte,” she answered,
smiling mischievously, “is full of interesting revelations—dreams
which come and go—but there is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
dream that is always there—the dream of love. Women,”
she added, “women, women everywhere in
Monsieur’s life; as in the years that were past, so in
the years to come. Let the Vicomte de Nérac be on
his guard against all women—and against one woman
in particular——”</p>

<p>André failed to suppress an exclamation. Had this
beautiful witch divined that secret too?</p>

<p>“Her name,” she paused to bury her face in the
cat’s fur, “is—Yvonne—Yvonne,” she repeated, “of
the Spotless Ankles.”</p>

<p>“Yvonne!” he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Yes, Yvonne. Sometimes there is more in a peasant
girl to tempt and ruin than in a Comtesse des
Forges, or a marquise—” it was her turn to laugh.
“Ah! the Vicomte is a gallant and reckless lover. He
thinks as the <i>noblesse</i> think, that women are necessary
to him. But it is not so. It is he who is necessary
to them.”</p>

<p>“And your fee for the advice, mistress?”</p>

<p>She flung the five gold pieces of Madame d’Étiolles
into a drawer. “Madame has paid for both,” she said.
“But if the Vicomte de Nérac will offer something of
his own, I will accept—a kiss,” and she looked him
daringly in the face.</p>

<p>The hall of the Château de Beau Séjour swept in
a vision before him. <i>Dieu Le Vengeur</i> seemed to be
written in a scroll of fire round the cat’s ruff.</p>

<p>“I understand,” she added with a contemptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
shrug of her shoulders, “though I am not a marquise
or a comtesse.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” he blurted out with husky
petulance.</p>

<p>She put her hand to her diamond cross—they looked
at each other—the woman melted into a defiant
reverence.</p>

<p>“The horse of Monsieur le Vicomte,” she commanded
quickly to the girl who had appeared as if by
magic. “Good-day, sir. You can pay the fee to—Yvonne.”</p>

<p>And here he was alone with the shifty-eyed <i>fille de
chambre</i>, who plainly gave him an invitation to mistake
her for Yvonne.</p>

<p>“Confound you, what do you wait for?” André said
irritably. “Fetch the horse at once if you don’t want
to taste a rogue’s fare with your mistress in prison.”</p>

<p>And as he rode through the woods it was little comfort
to remember that he had won his wager with
Henri, Comte de St. Benôit.</p>

<small>THE KING’S HANDKERCHIEF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> December the Duchesse de Châteauroux, the
<i>maîtresse en titre</i> of the King of France, had died, some
said of poison, some of a broken heart at her treatment
at Metz when she had been driven by her enemies
from the sick King’s bedside and from the Court, a few
because she had caught a chill and even <i>maîtresses en
titre</i> were mortal. Would Louis select another lady
to take her place? Who would she be? That was the
question. France was at war—that dreary war called
in the books the “War of the Austrian Succession”—and
this spring—1745—under the Maréchal de Saxe,
(the son of a king and Aurora von Konigsmarck, himself
the idol of women of quality as he had been the idol
of Adrienne Lecouvreur) great efforts were to be made
to drive from the Low Countries the red-coated English
and white-coated Austrians, to win for the Fleurs-de-Lis
the boundaries that, since the days of Henri IV.,
God, nature, and French genius had destined to be
French. Was not Louis, <i>Le Bien Aimé</i>, himself going
to the campaign with the flower of his nobility and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
with his son and heir? Yes, surely great things would
be accomplished before the September winds shook the
apples off the trees in the orchards of Normandy or
they trod the wine-vats on the sun-clad slopes of Gascony.
Paris was in a fever of excitement; the Court
was still <i>en fête</i> for the marriage of Monsieur le
Dauphin to a Saxon princess. But would there be a
successor to the hapless Duchesse de Châteauroux?
That was the only question about which the Paris that
counted really cared.</p>

<p>André of course went to tell St. Benôit how he had
won his bet, and he found him gossiping in the salon
of the Comtesse des Forges.</p>

<p>“The King has already chosen,” Madame remarked,
fanning herself placidly. “But Monseigneur the Archbishop
and the royal confessor are still able to work on
his remorse, so for the present His Majesty affects to
play at being a <i>dévot</i>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” St. Benôit retorted. “The
King will be a <i>dévot</i> for one day in the week and a lover
for the other six, as all kings of France and their subjects,
too, ought to be. Naturally he does not wish to
shock Madame la Dauphine, but wait till the campaign
is over; Mars will give way to Venus, and then
we shall have one of the De Nesles back again.”</p>

<p>Whereat Madame lifted her heavy-lidded eyes, of
which she was so proud, and said contemptuously,
“Pooh!”</p>

<p>“I have won the wager,” André interposed, “and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
will undertake to win another. I will bet that it will
not be a De Nesles, but a <i>bourgeoise</i> that the King
will select.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” both St. Benôit and Madame cried,
genuinely shocked. “A <i>bourgeoise</i> at Versailles! It
would be a scandal, unheard of, monstrous, not to be
tolerated.”</p>

<p>But André only smiled, and press him as they might
he refused to say more.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Comtesse, “if you will go to-night,
my dear De Nérac, to the ball at the Hôtel-de-Ville
you will learn whether I am not right.” And after
André had taken his leave she turned to St. Benôit,
with genuine concern. “England,” she said, “has
demoralised our dear friend. The English have made
him incredibly vulgar. As if the King of France
would so far forget himself or be so impertinent to us
as to introduce into our Versailles a <i>bourgeoise</i>. There
would be a revolution.”</p>

<p>“I can see you, Madame,” he answered, “giving
the lady her footstool.” He kneeled mockingly at her
feet. “God bless my soul! you might as well expect
me to kiss the hand of your <i>fille de chambre</i>. André
was joking; he knows if the King were to bring her to
Court she would not stay a week.”</p>

<p>“A week!” Madame threw up her noble head.
“Not twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>But André, who had heard the crystal’s story, had
his good reasons. Already fertile schemes were fermenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in his brain; his ambition, too, was daily soaring
upwards, and he dimly guessed that in this strange
circling of Fortune’s wheel the opportunity for which
he thirsted would at last come. And so like the rest
of the gay world he went that night to the grand ball
given by the municipality of Paris at the Hôtel-de-Ville
in honour of the marriage of the Dauphin; for the King
had promised to be present, and it was to be one of those
rare occasions when the <i>noblesse</i> had consented to rub
shoulders with the middle class in doing honour to the
royal bride and bridegroom. Coming events were in
the air. André felt, though why he could not say, that
to-night would somehow prove a decisive turning-point
in the history of himself and of France.</p>

<p>For the purpose of dancing, the court of the Hôtel-de-Ville
had been converted into a ballroom, superbly
festooned and illuminated, and the crowd that had
gathered was immense. Nobles of the realm, great
ladies, peers, peeresses, and the Court here jostled in
the wildest confusion with the gentlemen of the robe,
with aldermen, shopkeepers, and even flower girls and
the <i>danseuses</i> of the royal ballet. The company was
supposed to be masked, but many had already discarded
the flimsy covering; and for all who still wore it
the disguise was the merest affectation. Most of the
ladies of the middle class had donned fancy attire, but
the <i>noblesse</i> for the most part showed their quality by
refusing to imitate the <i>canaille</i>. André of course was
content with his uniform of the Chevau-légers de la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Garde, that beautiful and famous livery of scarlet
with white facings, silver buttons, spurs of gold, and
hat with white plumes which in itself conferred an enviable
distinction, and about his neck, more proudly
still, he carried that Croix de St. Louis, whose possession
sufficed to make any soldier happy.</p>

<p>For a few minutes he stood gazing at the brilliant
spectacle presented by the moving throng,—one vast
arena of human beings in which the uniforms, the stars
and ribbons, the jewels, the bright eyes, and the fair
shoulders were blended into a magic and inspiring
panorama, over which floated the tender music of harp,
violin, and flute. And as he moved slowly forward
kissing noble hands, receiving gentle congratulations,
or looking into eyes to which in past days he had
whispered devotion in the Œil de Bœuf or beneath the
balmy fragrance of a <i>fête champêtre</i> at Rambouillet his
ambition soared still higher. But dance he would not;
he had come to watch, to teach, and to learn. The
Chevalier to his joy was not here; he had been despatched,
André discovered with grim satisfaction, on
special business of the King. But yonder was Denise,
holding a miniature court. As André edged his way
towards her, her glance fell on the familiar uniform,
and it plainly said: “Here at least let us forget the
past—I have forgiven you—come let us be friends as
we were before.” And André replied to her graceful
reverence with his stiffest bow, as he had deliberately
come to do, and then moved slowly off, but not before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
he had marked with a lover’s joy the pained surprise
in Denise’s eyes, the angry flush that coloured her
cheek. But the lesson must be completed. A partner
must be found and at once. He paused—looked about
him—started.</p>

<p>“You, Madame!” he ejaculated, checking his astonishment,
for Denise was watching him.</p>

<p>“I, Monsieur le Vicomte,” was the serene reply.
“This is more fun than spelling the truth from a
crystal,” and she laughed wickedly.</p>

<p>Yes, it was indeed the wise woman from “The Cock
with the Spurs of Gold,” wearing her diamond cross
and dressed in adorably pale blue satin, just such a
colour as her eyes covered by the pale blue mask.
Strangest of all, André felt at that moment there was
not a woman in all this throng who carried herself
with more of the true air of the <i>noblesse</i> than did this
young sorceress, who plied a charlatan’s trade for hire.</p>

<p>“The Vicomte looks to-night as the Vicomte de
Nérac should,” she remarked quietly. “But is it my
presence here or is it my perfume that perplexes you?”</p>

<p>And André started again at her unerring divination.</p>

<p>“Surely it is very simple,” she proceeded. “Recall,
if you please, a supper party in London—the perfume
was there then—now it is here. That is all.”</p>

<p>“What?” He stopped in sheer amazement. “You
are that—that woman?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. The same, only a trifle disguised. In
London I was dark, in Paris I am fair, because,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
shrugged her shoulders, “I love change and I hate
being recognised unless I choose. You will not betray
my secret, will you?”</p>

<p>“No. But why are you in Paris?”</p>

<p>“Women like myself,” she answered cynically, “are
always dying of <i>ennui</i>, and I was born a Parisienne.
Can a Parisienne live without Paris? Well, I cannot.
London, <i>mon Dieu!</i> Those suffocating English! They
make love as they eat beef and drink beer. Their women
are prudes, their men heavy as bull-dogs made of
lead. London is a <i>ville de province</i>—no wit, no ideas,
no life. Here,” she pointed with her fan, “it is far
different. Where will you find the like of that for gaiety
of heart, and sparkle of the soul? It is the city of
breeding, of philosophers, of poets, of chivalry, and of
lovers. Why, that grisette over there can be more
<i>spirituelle</i> than an Englishman of genius. And when
even the lovers who make love with ardour and in
couplets that sing of themselves become annoying I go
elsewhere.”</p>

<p>André listened with a puzzled delight. It was not
the perfume—it was the mystery that enveloped her
which kept him silent. Something in her voice, her
manner, reminded him in the most tantalising way of
somebody else and for the life of him he could not
think who that somebody was.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied to his invitation, “I will not disgrace
you by dancing—you the Vicomte de Nérac and
I—” she smiled. “Besides you have seen me dance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in the only kind of dancing that I care about. But
see,” she added, dropping her voice, “do you not
recognise a friend, perhaps a partner? Is she not
charming—conquering and to conquer?”</p>

<p>“Name of a dog!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Away at the other end of the ballroom was a raised
dais on which was gathered a bevy of the fairest of the
<i>bourgeoisie</i>. One of them, escorted by three or four
gentlemen, was descending the stairs into the throng—a
woman in the guise of Diana, clad in the airiest,
gauziest, purest white, with a silver bow in her hand
and a quiver on her shoulder and a jewelled half-moon
in her powdered hair. It was—yes, it was—the fair
huntress of the woods of Versailles, to-night a matchless
spectacle of majestic beauty which rippled over into
the gayest, most provocative coquetry imaginable—Juno
and Venus and Diana in one and defying you to
say which was the more divine. And that cunningly
arranged robe of glittering white, with its artful jewels
to suggest every curve and line, was just what witchery
would have chosen to be the foil to the laughter of her
eyes and the subtle sheen of her skin. What other
woman could have worn it? But for the one who
dared, it was the homage of a woman’s art to the
triumph of nature’s womanhood.</p>

<p>André watched her with absorbing interest. Fate
had ordained that this woman’s ambitions should be
bound up with his. But how? how?</p>

<p>“She has a mind,” his companion was saying, “as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
well as incomparable beauty. That Abbé at her elbow
is Monsieur de Bernis, a poverty-stricken poet who
writes her love-letters for her, whom she will make great
some day, perhaps, and if Monsieur de Voltaire cared
as much for balls as for the muses, he, too, would be
snarling his honeyed venom in her ear. She can act
and dance and sing. She will not always be Madame
d’Étiolles.”</p>

<p>The plans of years were sweeping through André’s
brain. What if the crystal—the thought was cut short
by a stately flourish of trumpets and the loud hum of
applause.</p>

<p>“See,” the sorceress whispered, “the King has
arrived.”</p>

<p>Men and women pressed to the entrance and then fell
back—on all sides the lowliest reverences. The King,
the master of France, had entered and was facing the
crowd. And a truly royal figure he made in his splendid
dress, for Louis XV. knew how to present himself
as a worthy grandson of the Sun God who had created
Versailles and made monarchy in Europe sublime:
the pose of his handsome head, the dignity of his carriage,
the matchless air of command that conveyed an
air of majesty such as could only belong to one whose
wish since boyhood was law, whose words were orders,
whose will was the inspiration of a nation. And when
you marked that faint mysterious smile, those blue eyes
delicately dull, was he not just like his grandfather,
indefinable and impenetrable? What was the real man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
concealed behind that regal presence? What were the
real thoughts masked by that gaze, slightly bored yet
caressing and sweet?</p>

<p>“You do not like the King?” André asked quickly,
for he had caught behind the pale blue mask a swift
glance which sent a shiver down his spine.</p>

<p>“I love him,” she answered, “as all we women do.
But I was thinking of the day when I am to be burnt
for a witch.”</p>

<p>It was not the truth and André knew it. A woman’s
jealousy, he thought—but that, too, he knew it was not.</p>

<p>“My friend,” she said, “go you and salute Madame
d’Étiolles. Perhaps you will see something later on
to amuse you,” and as if to assist him she glided from
him and was lost in the crowd.</p>

<p>She had divined his mind again. To speak with the
fair huntress was the resolve that had mastered him.
And to his satisfaction Madame no sooner recognised
him than she beckoned with her fan, smiling a shy
and intoxicating welcome.</p>

<p>André kissed her hand, looking into her eyes, imperial
eyes in which slumbered imperial ambitions,
such wonderful eyes, now blue, now grey, now softly
dark as the violet, now glittering with the lightest
mockery. “<i>Un morceau de roi</i>,” he muttered. “Yes,
by God! a <i>morceau de roi!</i>”</p>

<p>“Conduct me to yonder pillar,” she said presently,
“we can talk better there.”</p>

<p>But that was not her reason, for to reach the pillar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
they must pass near the King. Clearly Madame
d’Étiolles was bent on playing to-night the game of
the woods at closer quarters. André as he escorted
her now felt that all eyes, including Denise’s, were on
him, but he enjoyed it, walking slowly on the giddiest
tiptoes of bravado. In front of Louis, he paused to
make his reverence. Madame paused too, and as she
unslung her quiver to curtsey with more graceful ease
André could feel her tremble. The King’s roaming
gaze rested on them both. André’s salute he acknowledged
with a smile, a word or two of kind greeting,
but it was on the jewels on the breast of the huntress
that his bored eyes lingered.</p>

<p>“Fair archeress,” he said, “surely the shafts you
loose are mortal.”</p>

<p>Madame d’Étiolles flushed with pleasure, curtsied
again, and promptly passed on, without attempting to
reply.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> what a figure! Who the devil is she?”
André heard one of the gentlemen of the Chamber
mutter.</p>

<p>“You did that to perfection,” his partner whispered
by the pillar. “You are a man who understands women,
and they are so rare. And now we will dance if
you please.”</p>

<p>The sorceress was right. Madame d’Étiolles danced
divinely. She had been taught by the best masters,
but it was only art that she owed to their science. The
rest was her own.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe37_5" id="i_088">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="“Fair archeress,” he said, “surely the shafts you loose are mortal">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Fair archeress,” he said, “surely the shafts you loose are mortal.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Will you please do what I tell you?” she whispered
as the violins tripped out a stately minuet. “And trust
me.”</p>

<p>“Rely on me, Madame,” he answered.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly Madame d’Étiolles in her minuet drew
nearer and nearer to the King, who began to observe
them closely. A gleam of animation crept into his face
and the courtiers parted a little to permit His Majesty
a better view of this dainty dancer. Covert whispers,
knowing looks, commenced to run through the group.
Yes, the King was distinctly interested. But the fair
Diana paid no heed. She had only eyes for the superb
officer in the scarlet and white of the Chevau-légers de
la Garde, who was dancing as he had never danced
before.</p>

<p>“Throw your handkerchief,” came the soft command.</p>

<p>Completely puzzled André obeyed as in a dream.
His partner caught the handkerchief dexterously on
her fan and was rewarded by a ripple of delighted
laughter from the spectators.</p>

<p>“A forfeit, Vicomte,” she said loud enough for all
to hear, “I give you tit for tat,” and she pressed her
own to her lips, and tossed it back to him.</p>

<p>But it was not intended to reach him. The huntress
had calculated carefully and the handkerchief
lightly hit the King.</p>

<p>A flush shot into Louis’s face; Madame coloured
over neck and shoulders, she dropped her eyes, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
one swift glance at His Majesty. Silence, save for the
dying lullaby of the music. André’s heart beat fast,
but not so fast surely as was beating that ambitious
heart of the huntress prisoned in its jewels and white
satin.</p>

<p>What would the King do? Would he resent or
accept the challenge?</p>

<p>Gentlemen and ladies, nobles and <i>bourgeois</i> alike,
drew a deep breath. Ah! the King had picked up the
handkerchief—a second’s pause, the pause in which a
nation’s destiny may be decided—and then the King
smilingly threw the handkerchief back, fair and true,
at the audacious dancer.</p>

<p>A pent-up cry arose, hands were clapped. “The
King has thrown the handkerchief, the King has
thrown the handkerchief,” was the ringing sentence
on the lips of all.</p>

<p>Madame caught the royal gift and melted into an
enchanting reverence. One alluring side-glance under
demure eyelashes, a glance of challenge and of submission,
and she had taken André’s arm and glided
swiftly back to the dais.</p>

<p>“The King has thrown the handkerchief” still
rang round the crowded room. But where was the
dancer? She was gone—yes, actually gone without
waiting to follow up her victory. And of the expectant,
excited throng André alone recognised how unerring
was her tact. The huntress had accomplished her
object. Henceforward it would not be she who must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
hunt, for defiance to royal hunters can be more triumphant
than obedience.</p>

<p>André went over to Madame des Forges and St.
Benôit. “You have lost again,” he said, “and you
will confess it now.”</p>

<p>“It is infamous,” replied the Comtesse, with fierce
indignation. “Infamous! But that grisette has not
won yet; the road from the Hôtel-de-Ville to Versailles
is long and difficult!”</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” André answered; “not when you can
travel in a royal carriage. You will see what you will
see when the campaign is over. The <i>bourgeoise</i> before
long will have the heel of her slipper on all our necks.”</p>

<p>“And you believe,” said the Comtesse, “that we
will permit her to be forced on us. You are as mad as
she is.”</p>

<p>She promptly took St. Benôit’s arm to mark her
anger at the part André had played. But he only
shrugged his shoulders in infinite amusement. A
week ago, true enough, he had scorned to lend himself
to such tactics, but to-night he was insensible to the
reproach that his noble blood should have felt. For
he, too, was under the spell of fate and of a witchery
far more potent than the drug of any magician. It
was not in mortal man to resist the sorcery of that fair
huntress who played on human and royal passion as a
musician on a stringed instrument. But there was
more than mere passion in that dainty wimple of cambric
and lace: “<i>La Petite d’Étiolles</i>” was gambling for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
a great stake. What if she were to be his ally in his
great game? Before André there unrolled a wonderful
vision of the future. He was necessary to these women.
<i>Bien!</i> They should be necessary to him, and
bitter as was the contempt in Denise’s pure eyes it
only steeled his determination remorselessly to tread
the path he had planned towards his goal—Denise.</p>

<p>The King had lost his interest and left the ball. He
had entered it a free man; he left it in thraldom. And
all Paris knew now that for good or evil the reversed
crown of the Duchesse de Châteauroux lay in the lap
of another. How long would she be permitted to
wear it?</p>

<p>As André hastened to leave, a touch was laid on his
arm. “Do you believe in the crystal now?” asked a
gently derisive voice.</p>

<p>Ah! the sorceress! he had forgotten her. “You
are a true witch,” he said, “you will certainly be
burnt. But I thank you.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” she replied and she took the arm
he offered. They walked in silence in search of her
carriage.</p>

<p>“Why do you hate politics?” André demanded
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Because,” she answered slowly, “it is the women
to whom politics are a passion who ruin kingdoms.”
The vehemence of the reply was as surprising as its
nature. “Women,” she added, “governed the great
Louis Quatorze, they corrupted the Regent, they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
bring our sovereign and his kingdom to be the scorn
of the world. Better a hundred witches, a hundred
wantons, than one woman whose passion it is to govern
a kingdom through its King. That is the woman who
should be burnt.”</p>

<p>It was a new idea to André: it would have been a
new idea to the salons of the Faubourg St. Germain, to
the galleries of Versailles.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she continued, “when a woman is not content
to be a wife and a mother she deserves to be treated
only as the idol of an hour, the pastime of a fleeting
passion.”</p>

<p>“O Madame!”</p>

<p>“O Monsieur!” she retorted. “Believe me, it is
pleasanter for the women in the end and better for the
men that such women should be denied everything
except that for which they live—pleasure.”</p>

<p>They had reached the carriage.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the pay for which you asked?”
he questioned, taking her hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can never forget it.”</p>

<p>“Then——”</p>

<p>She stepped serenely into the carriage. “Then,”
she whispered, “I shall get it, I suppose, when I really
want it,” and she swiftly shut the door in his face.
“Drive to the hotel of the Duc de Pontchartrain,” was
her order.</p>

<p>André swore softly. The Duke was his friend and
also perhaps the greatest libertine in Paris. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
should not escape him. In a quarter of an hour he
was supping with the Duke and his merry crew; women
there were in plenty, but this sorceress, the
daughter of a Paris flower girl, had neither been invited
nor had so much as exchanged a word with his
grace. And when André, weary of lansquenet, ribald
songs, and copious toasts, slunk to bed with the rising
sun he was strangely glad that she had tricked him.
But if she was not what she so cynically professed to
be what did it mean? And why in her presence did
he always have that irritating feeling that somewhere
and somehow he had met her before?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE VIVANDIÈRE OF FONTENOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun of spring had set on May 10, 1745, the eve
of a day memorable in the military annals of the British
and French nations. Behind a camp-fire in the
entrenchments of Fontenoy André warmed himself,
one of the many camp-fires which flared into the dusk
on that plain which for two centuries has been the
cock-pit of Europe; and as he stared out absently into
the swiftly falling night an answering gleam scarcely
a mile and a half away yonder to the south-east at
Maubray told him that there lay the headquarters of
the allied forces of the foe, English, Dutch, and Austrians,
commanded by an English prince of the blood-royal,
the Duke of Cumberland.</p>

<p>There had been some warm skirmishing to-day.
The British and the Austrians by sheer weight of numbers
had tumbled out of the enclosures and copses the
Pandours and Grassins thrown out as irregular out-posts
from the French army; and since then André
and St. Benôit with many others had watched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
allied generals and their staff reconnoitring at a safe
distance the masterly position drawn along the slopes
of Fontenoy by Monseigneur le Maréchal de Saxe. A
hard nut to crack, gentlemen, these lines, study them
through your spy-glasses as you will. Nor will you
find it easy to detect the place to push through. Yes;
you may attack any time now night or day, for Tournay
to our rear is hard pressed and unless relieved will
fall into the hands of our master, Louis XV. Well
and good; what better could a Chevau-léger de la
Garde desire than that the pot-bellied Dutch traders,
the Austrian hounds, and the British dogs should dash
themselves to pieces on our lines. Mark you how the
trenches run from the forest of Barry covering our left
away in the north, winding in a gentle semicircle
along the rim of the curving slope two miles and more
down to the spot where the Château of Anthoin guards
the passage of the sluggish Scheldt. And meanwhile
we lie here snug and safe behind our redoubts bristling
with guns, with logs cut from the forest piled breast-high
to aid the advantage our general has given us,
and with the flower of the French army crouched and
ready to roll you up when you come. See how open
the plain in front is, sloping gradually away from us;
we can hammer you in the most murderous fashion
from under cover if you are mad enough to dream
that any troops can drive from its lair a French army
that remembers Dettingen and will have Tournay or
perish. Our Maréchal de Saxe, who knows something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
of the art of war, has pronounced it impossible, and
God have mercy on your silly, reckless souls if you
try, for the French guards are here and the Maison du
Roi, and our King’s eye is on us to see that we do our
duty!</p>

<p>Yes, His Majesty is here and with him Monsieur le
Dauphin, and not a few ladies greatly daring, and the
royal household, chamberlains and equerries, serving-men
and serving-women, the bluest blood of France,
and the wenches of the commissariat, and the actors
and actresses of the Théâtre Français. Was there ever
such a medley—soldiers, courtesans, and sutlers,
thieves, marauders, sluts and wantons, and the gilded
coaches and footmen of the beauty and birth that have
the right to throng the Staircase des Ambassadeurs at
Versailles and have the <i>entrée</i> to the Grand Lever of
the King of France?</p>

<p>The camp-fires smoke into the chill dusk; the lights
twinkle in the packed villages where battalions of foot
bivouac with squadrons of horse. In front smoulders
and glares the hamlet of Bourgeon fired by our Grassins
when they were driven out this morning. Everywhere
the confused turmoil of a great camp, the sharp
blare of fitful trumpets, the dull throb of drums, a
feverish shot from yonder where skirmishing is still
going on, the neighing of horses, the rumble of waggons.
Hard by André here the men are taking their
evening meal, chattering, laughing, singing, dancing.
Such women as can live in camps are drinking too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
singing when they cannot thieve. There are wounded
to be cared for, or robbed; throats there are beyond
the lines to be cut, purses and gold lace to be won from
the fallen. Make love while you can. To-morrow’s
eve may never come. Have your season of pleasure,
Messieurs; to-morrow the wench whom you kiss to-night
will strip you in the dusk of the victory and
leave you to the mercy of the dogs, the spring frosts,
and of God—the God of battles.</p>

<p>Yes, to-morrow there will surely be a great battle.
Have not the actors promised it? “To-morrow no
performance! The day after to-morrow a play in
honour of the victory of Monseigneur le Maréchal de
Saxe!” And before long there will be a <i>Te Deum</i>
in the glorious aisles of the captured cathedral of
Tournay.</p>

<p>André on his straw heap curled in his cloak dreamed
of Denise, of the pleasant Loire, and of the Château de
Beau Séjour when it should be his. Pest on the <i>canaille</i>
and their trulls singing that lampoon at his
elbow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Une petite bourgeoise,</div>
<div class="indent">Élevée à la grivoise</div>
<div class="verse">Mesurant tout à la toise,</div>
<div class="indent">Fait de la cour un taudis, dis, dis.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>They were singing of no less a lady than the fair
huntress and the King, the heroine of the crystal and
the King’s handkerchief, “<i>La Petite d’Étiolles</i>,” who
was now the heroine and jape of the streets of Paris.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Strange, so strange. And he, too, had played his
part in the drama of royal love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Louis, malgré son scrupule,</div>
<div class="indent">Froidement pour elle brûle,</div>
<div class="verse">Et son amour ridicule,</div>
<div class="indent">A fait rire tout Paris, ris, ris.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>His friend! And he would find her at Versailles no
doubt when the campaign was over. How long would
she stay there, this ambitious <i>bourgeoise</i>?</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Lieutenant is sad.” Some one had
touched his arm. Ah! only a little <i>vivandière</i> whom
he did not recognise. “Monsieur le Vicomte has left
his mistress behind and he is sad,” she protested,
kneeling beside him and peering with bright eyes into
his ruffled visage.</p>

<p>“Run away, my dear,” André replied sleepily. “I
am poor, tired, and in a sad temper.”</p>

<p>“And I am poor, fresh, and in a charming temper,”
she retorted. “If Monsieur le Vicomte has left his
mistress behind there are still many women in the
world. Here is one!” She began to hum the refrain
of the song with the archest drollery: “A fait rire
tout Paris, ris, ris.”</p>

<p>André sat up. An appetising little <i>vivandière</i> this,
name of a dog! Plump and most bravely tricked out
in a military coat and short skirt which revealed what
would have made two dancers’ fortunes.</p>

<p>“If I give you a kiss will you go?” he said good-humouredly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Oh, no. The kisses of Monsieur le Vicomte are no
better than those of most men, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Then stay without them.” He closed his eyes and
lay down again.</p>

<p>“My thanks,” she nodded, gaily throwing back her
short cloak so as to reveal that her blue coat was open
at the throat and suggested a chemisette strangely fine
for a <i>vivandière</i>. Then she bent over him. “Would
you do a service for Mademoiselle the Marquise de
Beau Séjour?” André sat up, sharply. “Would you
do the King a service?” she whispered. “<i>Mon Dieu!</i>
how those women bleat! Come this way, Vicomte, I
have something to say to you—a secret.” She blew
him a kiss from saucy finger-tips.</p>

<p>André, now wide-awake, his blood tingling, followed
her till she stopped in the shadow of an outhouse.
“You will do the King a service?” she asked gravely
enough. “Answer in my ear; we must not be heard.
Yes?”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, quickly, “what the service is?”</p>

<p>“The Vicomte can talk English?”</p>

<p>“How the dev——?”</p>

<p>“It matters not how I know it. Do not contradict.
Time is precious. To-night”—she was speaking earnestly
into his ear—“the friends of the King have
learned that the secrets of the Maréchal will be betrayed
to the English.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” He gripped her arm.</p>

<p>“Hush!” She raised a warning finger. “It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
so. To the charcoal-burner’s hut two miles from here
will come at midnight two English officers. The plans
of the camp—this camp, Vicomte—will be given them;
to-night the English will know where to attack to-morrow
and then—” she made a significant gesture.</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“No one can say how those plans have been stolen.
But stolen they have been, and it is too late to alter
the entrenchments now. They are made—you understand—and
to-morrow is here in ten hours. Worse,
worse, the traitor is already at the cottage with the
paper.” André sweated hot and cold, for terror rang
in her pleading voice. “It is infamous, terrible. But
one hope remains. We must find an officer who can
speak English, who will pretend to be those English
officers and get the plans before they are handed to the
enemy. The Vicomte understands?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I see. I will go.” He buttoned up his
cloak with peremptory decision.</p>

<p>“Oh!” She sobbed with joy. She could not thank
him in words.</p>

<p>“And who are you?” André asked.</p>

<p>“Hush! hush! The army must not know of the
danger. If you must know, I am an actress, the friend
of Monseigneur le Maréchal. I alone have discovered
this, and I am come to you, for I, too, love France.”</p>

<p>The blood swirled for a minute in his temples. Ha!
when Denise heard how he, André de Nérac, alone
had saved France, the army, and the King, would she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
not be proud? Perhaps they would give him the
Cordon Bleu.</p>

<p>“What am I to do?” he asked quietly. “I am
ready.”</p>

<p>She described at length where the charcoal-burner’s
hut lay and how it could be reached. “When you are
there, rap twice on the door,” she proceeded, “and
then say in English to whoever comes, ‘I am from
“No. 101” to “No. 101.”’”</p>

<p>“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“The Vicomte knows what a cipher is? That is
the traitor’s cipher—and the traitor’s name. It is all
we have discovered.”</p>

<p>“A man, this traitor?”</p>

<p>“No one knows. I swear it. But it must be a man,
so say those words in English; speak in English,
always—always. Remember you are an officer of the
First Foot Guards of the English King; you have come
for the papers because ‘No. 101’ has bidden you. You
will get them if you are clever and God wills. Then
fly—fly for your life, and France is saved.”</p>

<p>“I will not fly till I have killed that traitor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, kill him if you can. But it is the papers you
must have or we are all ruined. The papers,” she
repeated in a dull agony.</p>

<p>André meditated. Then he took the <i>vivandière</i> by
both arms, “Will you swear by the name of the Holy
Virgin that this is no trap?” he asked solemnly.</p>

<p>She turned her hooded face up to his and took his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Croix de St Louis. “Before God and on this cross,”
she answered very slowly, “it is no trap. It is the
truth.”</p>

<p>Conviction rang in her low tones and she was trembling
with emotion.</p>

<p>“Very well. I am ready. But my uniform?” he
asked sharply. “I shall be recognised.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that,” she said. “See, my
room is in the village, a stone’s throw hence. A cloak,
a hat, and boots of the English Guard are there,
stripped from a dead officer. They will cover your
uniform. But you must keep the cloak buttoned, for
frock and tunic I have not got, alas! I have, too, my
actress’s box of colours. I will disguise you perfectly.
Come at once, there is no time to waste.”</p>

<p>And so by two flickering candles her deft fingers
transformed him swiftly into the image of a ruddy,
beef-fed English officer of the English Guard, and
when her work was done she accompanied him to the
edge of the lines, where they paused.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake be careful,” she urged. “The
Pandours, the Grassins, the marauders, are prowling
everywhere. Maybe, too, ‘No. 101’ may have varlets
on the look-out. I would not frighten you, but you
should know that the man or woman who has hunted
‘No. 101’—and several have tried—has so far met with
death.”</p>

<p>But André only smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she repeated, “all who have seen that traitor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
face to face have died. It is horrible, but the truth.
Get the papers, that is all we need. Pry no farther, I
beseech you. Ah, sir, a woman, even an actress,
would not have on her soul the blood of a gallant
gentleman who at her bidding risked all for France.”</p>

<p>“Death can come but once,” he answered, “and in
no nobler way than in the service of France and the
King.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but you must live. For the King
will be grateful, and I—I, too, will not forget.”</p>

<p>André smilingly put his hand on her shoulder.
“And is that all?” he asked lightly, “all my reward,
Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“Come back,” she whispered, “come back and you
will see whether it is all. Meanwhile, adieu and <i>au
revoir</i>.”</p>

<p>She had slipped from his grasp and vanished as
mysteriously as she had come. Who was she? Bah!
it did not matter now. The night and its work lay
before him. But to-morrow—to-morrow!</p>

<p>He mounted, gave the password, and rode into the
night.</p>

<p>Behind him lay the sleeping camp ignorant of its
peril, in front the strangest, weirdest, most dangerous
task he had ever embarked on; yet André felt no fear.
His only thought as he trotted down the slope was a
vivid reminiscence of the words of the crystal-gazer.
Women everywhere in his life—always women at every
turn—the princess in London—Yvonne—“<i>La Petite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
d’Étiolles</i>”—the crystal-gazer, and now the charming
little <i>vivandière</i>—but they were all so many instruments
to help him to win the fairest of them all—Denise.
It was clear as noonday now. His task was
to master the strand of the web in which these women,
by design or accident, enwrapped him, and to make
them serve his purpose while he seemed to serve theirs.
It was an idea which grew in power and fascination
every day. Women appealed to him by nature; before
the charm of mind and body in women he was defenceless,
but it was his love for Denise that had inspired
the conception of yoking the pleasure of life to the
attainment of a glorious ambition. To-night was a
matchless opportunity—and others would follow.</p>

<p>But his mind while it revolved was fully alert. He
believed in himself and his sword. His faith in his
star grew stronger each day. But fate and God helped
those who would best help themselves. To-night he
must not fail on this difficult task because he neglected
anything that caution could suggest.</p>

<p>From time to time he halted. The night was dark,
that was good, and a raw mist steamed out of the
sodden earth. He had taken the precaution to bind
his horse’s hoofs in soft cloth, and she, a powerful
English thoroughbred, his favourite mare, knew her
master’s will by instinct. The road, too, was easy to
find. No one crossed his path. And here at last was
the little wood of which he had been told. Half a
mile away gleamed dully a fire, probably an English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
picket. He dismounted and listened intently. Not a
sound. And now very warily he plunged forward into
the bowels of this grisly little wood, leading his horse,
his pistols cocked and sword ready. Presently he
stumbled; only a fallen log; he stumbled again; another?
No. This time it was a dead man. André
dragged him out and let the rays of his masked lantern
fall cautiously on his face. Poor wretch! half-naked
too—a common gallows bird of a marauder, stripped
by the thieves and with a knife-thrust in his throat, a
common enough spectacle to those who had played at
war before, mere carrion in the daylight, but causing
the flesh to creep in the raw chills of this infernal hiding-place
of treachery. Let him lie. And now forward
again. Pah! another corpse! A woman, and young,
too, that rascal’s companion no doubt, and stripped
as he was. He bent over her. Ha! what was that?
One hand gone? There had been a quarrel, the robbers
had killed her and her mate, and to save time had
simply chopped off her fingers to get the booty she had
gripped so tightly. Let her lie beside him there and
forward again, for such is war.</p>

<p>Halt! Here is the charcoal-burner’s cabin. He
could just make out its black outlines in a clearing of
the trees. André muffled his mare’s head and tied her
to a branch, and then with naked sword crawled forward
on hand and knees. Round the hut like a sleuth-hound
he wormed his way, learning the ground, making
absolutely sure no one lurked in this damp stillness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Positively not a soul, not a whisper. But the horror
of the dead man and woman and this awful stillness
had mastered him, and ten yards from the door he lay
for some minutes watching, thinking. The hut showed
no signs of life. What if “No. 101” were not there?
What if the English officers had forestalled him and
the papers were already gone? What if an ambuscade
were concealed in that ramshackle cabin?</p>

<p>Still he lay thinking, shivering, to start swiftly.
The shutter in the cabin wall was being slowly pushed
open. There was no glass in the window; a gleam of
red light; some one was stealthily looking out into the
night. André crawled on his stomach across the
clearing and lay flat down with a sharp gasp.</p>

<p>By the living God, it was a woman! A woman!</p>

<p>Two drops of icy sweat dripped from his forehead on
to the damp ground. A woman! Yes, he could see
the silhouette of her hooded head and bust etched
against the dull red light behind and the inky frame-work
of the window, and she was thinking too, resting
her elbow placidly on the sill. A woman! It was
terrible, for she was a traitor and he must kill her,
here in this cursed cabin, in this damned wood. She
moved her head and listened intently. Yes, she was
expecting some one. Ha! He was not too late.</p>

<p>The shutter was stealthily closed, but crouching
beneath it André heard the faint sigh as of a weary
heart. He sprang up, rapped twice on the door.</p>

<p>Steps within, the bolts were being drawn back. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
last a masked woman with a lantern in her hand stood
in the doorway, and he and she faced each other in
silence.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” she asked in a clear voice.</p>

<p>“I am from ‘No. 101’ to ‘No. 101,’” André answered
firmly, but inwardly he trembled and his sword was
ready to leap out.</p>

<p>She raised the lantern quietly and let the light travel
from his hat to his boots.</p>

<p>“Good,” she said. “Enter, sir.”</p>

<p>André paused. Could he dare? No—yes—no? For
two slow minutes the thoughts battled within him as
he strove to penetrate the secret of that mask and the
hood covering her head. She was young—quite
young. That faint sigh as of a weary heart seemed to
echo through the misty silence of the wood.</p>

<p>Then he stepped inside, and she quietly closed the
door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>AT THE CHARCOAL-BURNER’S CABIN IN THE WOODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> woman led the way into the kitchen which
opened off the tiny passage and André followed her.
The two faced each other in silence. Presently she
placed the lantern on the rough table in the centre of
the room and once again looked at him thoughtfully
through her mask. The only other light there was
came from the dying embers of a fire, whose murky
shadows flickered on the walls and on the low roof.</p>

<p>André with his fingers on his sword-hilt returned
her studied gaze. He could make out that her hair
under her hood was fair; her voice, her step, were
those of a girl, and what he could see of her figure
shrouded in its long cloak bid well to be shapely. Yes,
she was young, this woman, but a pest on that mask!</p>

<p>“You are not the officer I expected,” she remarked
at last.</p>

<p>“He was wounded; he could not come, so they sent
me in his place,” André answered at once.</p>

<p>“I understand,” she replied with a quiet nod, “but
they said two would be sent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“My companion is outside guarding the horses.”
Whereupon she lifted the lantern and inspected him
closely. André, ready for anything, stood quite still.
“If you doubt my word,” he added carelessly, “I will
take you to him now.”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, replacing the lantern on the
table, “your word is enough; the word of an English
officer,” and she turned to cross the kitchen.</p>

<p>André’s face was calmness itself, but his blood was
tingling with fear, curiosity, revenge. Never in his
adventurous life had he been so thrilled as at this
moment in this dim, silent kitchen, alone with this
cold-blooded traitress in a mask. But, mastered as he
was by an overpowering desire to probe her secret to
the bottom, he was also carefully studying every nook
and cranny. There was only one way out of the room—by
the door, which was half-open. He carefully
moved so that he might face it, and if a swift rush
were necessary not have the table between him and
the road to escape.</p>

<p>“There are the papers,” she said in her passionless
tones. She had taken them from a cupboard in the
wall.</p>

<p>He betrayed no eagerness, but his fingers trembled
and his heart thumped wildly as he looked them
through by the dim light of the lantern, one eye all
the time watching the masked girl, who quietly kneeled
down by the fire with her back to him and began to
blow on the embers with a bellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“They are what you want, are they not?” she
remarked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I believe so,” he answered as carelessly.</p>

<p>Yes, the <i>vivandière</i> was right. The paper was a
complete plan of the French encampment, marking
accurately the positions of each battalion and each
battery, and in the corner was drawn in blood a curious
sign—two crossed daggers with 101 inserted in the
gaps:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_dongle.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>It sent an icy shiver through him, this countermark of
the traitor’s success and good faith. God! they were
betrayed indeed to those damned Austrian hounds and
English dogs. But he, André de Nérac, had saved
the King and the army of France!</p>

<p>“I thank you,” he said, folding the paper up and
putting it deliberately within his cloak.</p>

<p>“I do not desire your thanks,” she replied as she
blew away some ashes.</p>

<p>André stared in dumb bewilderment at her on her
knees there in front of the fire. Should he run her
through at once or strangle her for an execrable traitress?
The woman betrayed neither fear nor interest.
She seemed to have forgotten his presence.</p>

<p>“Are you ‘No. 101’?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” She was laughing softly. “I am only
her—agent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Then the trait—then she is a woman?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She stood up and shook some cinders from
her cloak. “Yes, she is a woman.” And André
knew she was lying. The fingers on his sword relaxed.
Kill her he could not—yet. Depart he could
not—yet. For he was in the grip of a weird fascination—of
a secret whose mystery numbed his senses.</p>

<p>“It is marvellous,” he muttered, “but the English
army thanks ‘No. 101’ and you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered indifferently, “it is marvellous,
but the English army is nothing to her nor to me.
For myself I detest the English officers, but like you,
sir, I simply do as I am bid. Give me the gold and I
will wish you good-night.”</p>

<p>The gold; English gold! Pest on it! The <i>vivandière</i>
and he had thought of everything but that. The
perspiration swelled on to his forehead. He grasped
his sword and took a step towards the doorway.</p>

<p>“I was given no gold,” he said brusquely and
waited with drawn breath.</p>

<p>“No?” She shrugged her shoulders and astonished
him by kneeling down and taking up the bellows. “It
is like English officers to buy secrets and not pay for
them.”</p>

<p>“You are unjust to the English,” he protested.
Ah! that surely was a stroke of genius.</p>

<p>“I know them, the English,” she said without
looking round.</p>

<p>Dead silence broken only by the wheezy puffs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
bellows. Pity, fear, astonishment, and a burning curiosity
wrestled in André’s breast. Was this masked
girl flesh and blood or a devil in human form?</p>

<p>“Do you want the papers back?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“They are not mine to ask. I was told to give
them to you; keep them.”</p>

<p>The icy contempt in her voice stung him. If it had
not been for France he would have flung them at her
and then strangled her on the spot.</p>

<p>“Before I wish you good-night,” he said after a
pause, “will you do me the honour to remove your
mask?”</p>

<p>“Why?” She wheeled slowly, still on her knees.</p>

<p>“Why does even an English officer ask a woman to
do such a thing?”</p>

<p>She rose and came close to him. “I will take off
my mask with pleasure,” she said, “if you, sir, will
do me the honour to take off your cloak and share my
supper.”</p>

<p>André could not check a start. Had she guessed
the truth or was this diabolical coquetry?</p>

<p>“Permit me,” she said softly, and before he could
move a finger she had wrenched his cloak asunder.
“Ah!” she cried, “I thought so. A hero in the uniform
of a Chevau-léger de la Garde with a naked
sword and I—a woman—defenceless, alone. You an
English officer—you—you!”</p>

<p>She had slipped from his side. The table with the
smoking lantern was between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Monsieur le Vicomte de Nérac,” she whispered,
“any woman can make a fool of you.”</p>

<p>André slammed the door behind him. “Traitress,”
he swore. “Your last hour has come.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him calmly. “Listen,” she said,
“listen! Monsieur Spy. To-morrow you will be shot
by the English—and the papers”—she laughed—“will
still help towards the ruin of France.”</p>

<p>André halted sharply. What was that outside?
Horse hoofs in the clearing—two horses! The English
officers were here and he was trapped, trapped, as
God lived, by a woman who flouted his uniform and
himself.</p>

<p>“You will not escape,” he said with set teeth, “and
I have the papers.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” she flicked her cloak in his face.</p>

<p>A loud rapping on the outer door.</p>

<p>“Enter,” she called. “Enter, Captain Statham,
the door is not bolted.”</p>

<p>Captain Statham! They had met again and not in
the salon of a woman of pleasure. André laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>The latch was being lifted. It was now or never.
Twisting his cloak round his left arm as the Spaniard
does in a duel with knives, in a trice André, sword in
hand, was over the table with the spring of a cat.
When he had punished this traitress he would deal
with Captain Statham. But the woman was too quick
for him. The legs of the table met him in the stomach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and sent him staggering back. Through the sickening
pain he could hear her soft laugh of victorious
contempt. A crash. She had hurled the lamp to the
floor and was past him, missing his sword point by
just half an inch. The blade quivered in the woodwork.
Half-mad, he grabbed at her mask—it came
off—but she was gone.</p>

<p>“We shall meet again,” she called, “your business
and mine I hope does not end here.” A spurt of
flame shot into his eyes. The oil of the exploded lamp
had set the dry, rotten timbers ablaze and the kitchen
was alight. Quick as thought André hurled himself
after the girl. She had doubled to the right—there
was another door as he guessed leading to the back—she
was through it and he after her, snatching at her
figure in the pitchy darkness. For two seconds he
held her cloak—she twisted out of it—and he fell back
with a curse against the wall. She had escaped.</p>

<p>And now the flame from the kitchen revealed Captain
Statham standing in the front doorway, stupefied,
his eyes glaring like a madman’s. With a cry he
flung himself on André. A cold pain in his left arm—André
was stabbed—but this was no moment for
vengeance, only for flight, for on his escape hung the
safety and honour of France. He rushed into the
open at the back. To find his horse—to find his
horse!</p>

<p>“I have seen her,” he heard Statham cry as he
whipped round the cabin. It would be a race across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the clearing now, for Statham’s companion must be
waiting on the other side, and in the roar of flame it
would be as light as day in this grisly thicket. What
if his horse were not there? Two to one then. Bah!
should he turn to meet them as it was? No, the papers—the
papers first—vengeance would follow later.</p>

<p>For one second André crouched behind the hut.
Ah! there was his horse—there was the other officer
twenty paces off. Could he do it? He must.</p>

<p>“<i>Jésu!</i>” came the words in the voice of George
Onslow as André doubled round the corner, “it is the
Vicomte, Statham; we are betrayed. This way for
God’s sake—ha!”</p>

<p>Crack went Onslow’s pistol. André had leaped
across the clearing. He had missed, but the flash
almost singed André’s hair.</p>

<p>One slash of his sword and his horse was free.</p>

<p>“Good-night, gentlemen,” he shouted in victorious
bravado, “we shall meet to-morrow. <i>Mes saluts et au
revoir!</i>”</p>

<p>In went the spurs and his maddened horse was
bursting through the wood. Another pistol-shot and
they were after him, but he had a good start and he
knew that no beast alive could overhaul the beautiful
blood mare he had bought in England. A roar of
flame behind him—the crack of the wood—two pistol
bullets singing through the swirling raw air—a ghastly
vision of that half-naked man and woman in the horror
of the clotted grass, his horse’s hoofs stamping out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
dead woman’s face as she lay where he had left her—a
ride as of devil-tormented goblins through the pains
of hell—that was André’s recollection of his return
until he dropped fainting within his own lines.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two flickering candles danced in his eyes as he
opened them.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” whispered a caressing voice. “Bravo!”</p>

<p>He was lying in a long chair and the little <i>vivandière</i>
was kneeling beside him.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” she repeated, “and now drink—drink!”
She forced brandy, glorious and hot, down his throat.</p>

<p>“Ah!” He sat up. The horror was slowly fading
away, though he could still see floating between her
face and his that black cabin roaring red, and that
outcast woman’s face crushed into pulp beneath the
iron of his horse’s shoe. “The papers—the plans,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“They are here,” she waved them softly, they were
stained with blood. “Yes, we are saved—France and
the army and the King are saved and you—you have
saved us.”</p>

<p>André smiled, letting his head drop. He was
supremely happy. Denise would hear of this—Denise—ah!</p>

<p>“Come, my friend,” the <i>vivandière</i> whispered,
“look at yourself. It is too droll.”</p>

<p>He took the mirror from her and laughed—laughed
loud and long. Here was, indeed, a picture of a ruffian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
with a uniform torn and singed, the paint smeared
over his cheeks, one sleeve cut away, and his left arm
bandaged! Pah! that was where Statham had stabbed
him. He would pay for it to-morrow—no, to-day—to-day.</p>

<p>“I found the papers when you fainted,” said the
<i>vivandière</i>. “I wept when I found them, for I was
sick with fear that you had failed, and now, <i>mon ami</i>,
I take them to Monseigneur le Maréchal.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mademoiselle, they are yours.”</p>

<p>Then André told his story while she listened eagerly.
But he did not tell her all, for instinctively he felt
some things he had discovered that night had better be
locked as a secret in his own heart until he knew more.</p>

<p>“I do not think that was ‘No. 101,’” she remarked
thoughtfully. “But it is a pity you did not see her
face. Some day hereafter it might be useful to be able
to recognise that woman.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” he assented, and he added to himself,
“I shall see it before I die. It is written in the stars.”
For the curious thought haunted his mind that if he
had seen that woman’s face he would never have returned.
Yet Captain Statham had seen it; suddenly
his cry, his look in that narrow passage, rose before
him. Was it what he had seen which had shot such
awful fear and horror into his eyes? Could it be that
the girl in the mask was—ah! he must wait before the
question was answered. And the answer would certainly
come. That too was written in the stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“And now sleep, Vicomte,” his companion whispered.
“In four hours the dawn will be here. A
battle is at hand, and once more you must fight for the
fair eyes of your mistress, for the honour of France
and the King.”</p>

<p>She half-carried him to the bed. The flame-red
pictures of the night kept shooting through a blackness
of pain in his eyes. How tired and weak he was.
From far away a trumpet note rang, a drum throbbed,
a snatch of revelling song bubbled mockingly up:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Et son amour ridicule,</div>
<div class="verse">A fait rire tout Paris, ris, ris.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“I made a promise,” dropped the soothing words in
his ear, “but Monsieur le Vicomte must never betray
the secret to Monseigneur and the King. Yet remember,
I beg, there is nothing—nothing—I will not do for
you if I can serve you, for I am grateful—more grateful
than a woman can say.” A cushion was slipped
under his neck. Two soft arms enfolded him for a
brief second. “The lips, Vicomte” came the caressing
chant—“the lips that a king has kissed salute you.”
His head rested on her breast. “Adieu!” She had
vanished and his numbed senses ebbed away into an
enchanted oblivion. The Loire floated at his feet, the
autumn trees rustled a perfect pleasantness and peace,
and Denise standing beneath the carved mantelpiece
with “<i>Dieu Le Vengeur</i>” in a scroll of gold above her
had him in her forgiving arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Ha! What was that? Hoarse voices and cries, the
rush of feet, of horses, of waggons, and of guns, the
rattle of the drums and the challenge of trumpets.
André leaped up, flung the window wide open. The
dawn was here, and hark, hark! Those are the silver
trumpets of the Chevau-légers de la Garde de la Maison
du Roi. The trumpets of the Guard calling as
they called at Steinkirk. To horse! to horse!</p>

<p>And what is that away yonder through the pearly
mist of the morning out there in the enclosures and
coppices dripping in the dew of May? Answering
calls and the feverish thud of drums. They are coming—the
white-coated Austrian hounds and the red-coated
English dogs! They are coming! To horse!
to horse! For to-day we must fight for the honour of
France—fight that we may have the play promised to
the army by the actresses of the Théâtre Français
when Monseigneur the Maréchal de Saxe has won yet
another victory for His Majesty, Well-Beloved. Ah,
they shall see, those English dogs, what lies in the
hearts and swords of the nobles of the Guard. Fontenoy!
Neither they nor we will ever forget Fontenoy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>FONTENOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dull boom of a gun away on the right greeted
André as he flung himself into the saddle, and the
trumpets were echoing all along the line from the
citadel of Anthoin over the slopes on which the brigaded
army lay right up to the forest of Barry which
covered the French left. A plumed officer galloped up
to him. It was the Chevalier de St. Amant.</p>

<p>“The Dutch and the Austrians,” he cried, “are
concentrating opposite us on our right, but the centre
of the attack will be”—he waved his sword northwards
of Fontenoy—“the English form the enemy’s right
flank.”</p>

<p>“And the Maison du Roi?”</p>

<p>“Will make the third line of the cavalry behind the
carbineers and the foot guards yonder. But you are
wounded, Vicomte?”</p>

<p>“A scratch—nothing at all,” André replied
brusquely.</p>

<p>The Chevalier looked at him, smiled, and galloped
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>It was past seven o’clock. André paused to cast a
hasty eye out towards Maubray and Veyon, whence
the foe must come. Around him staff officers cantered
this way and that; hoarse orders were being shouted,
regiments were falling in, deploying, lining the entrenchments,
one, two, three deep. Everywhere the
strenuous confusion and fierce excitement of an army
hurriedly preparing for battle. Over the plain hung
a soft grey mist gently rolling up as the day grew,
but dimly in the distance, past the enclosures and the
coppices in the midst of which the wrecked hamlet of
Bourgeon still smoked sullenly in the raw air, troops—cavalry
mainly—were collecting. Yes, the enemy
really meant business. It was to be an assault along
the whole front and there was no time to waste.</p>

<p>With the Chevau-légers de la Garde André found
St. Benôit.</p>

<p>“Where the devil have you been?” his friend demanded.
“We looked for you everywhere last night.
Jeannette and Gabrielle supped in my coach.”</p>

<p>“Two assignations,” André laughed. “Such fun,
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“And you got that slit between the two, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a good deal more. Hullo! What’s
that?”</p>

<p>The guns from the citadel and the redoubts on the
slopes had begun in real earnest, answered as yet feebly
from the enemy’s left. St. Benôit and André trotted
forward to make the position out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“Mark you there!” cried St. Benôit. “Those are
English cavalry forming up and see—see! There
come the red-coated blackguards behind ’em. By
God! they’re going to let us give ’em a taste of our
quality.”</p>

<p>“Do you imagine they will dare to march across the
plain in the teeth of our artillery?” André asked.</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” St. Benôit replied smiling.
“And so much the better.”</p>

<p>The pair watched eagerly. The rattle of muskets
crackled up from the left—the skirmishers, the Pandours
and Grassins are out, and every minute it is hotter
and hotter work; the smoke drifts up, and through
it they can catch glimpses of red-coated infantry falling
in, company on company, battalion upon battalion,
in the rear of the covering squadrons of horse. Ha!
our guns up here have chimed in now, and already
there are empty saddles in the dragoons so placidly
arrayed amongst the lanes and enclosures, but those
stolid islanders mind it as little as a fisher does flies on
a July day. Down rolls the smoke, wafting in sullen
clouds, shrouding the slope and the enclosures, only
broken by fitful puffs of air or torn by red flashes and
the dull plunge of the round shot. Yet this is a mere
prelude up here, though on our right the engagement
has really begun.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur, poor devil!” whispered St. Benôit,
“but what a spirit.”</p>

<p>Yes, that is Monseigneur le Maréchal de Saxe, carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
in a wicker litter, for he cannot sit his horse. He
is dying of dropsy is Monseigneur, but he will see for
himself, and as he is carried along he sucks a leaden
bullet to assuage his raging thirst. The fire of battle
glows in those eyes which Adrienne Lecouvreur and
so many women have adored, and it inspires every
man on whom his glance falls, so full of confidence and
calm is he as he issues his orders, serene, majestic, and
watchful. No troops in the world can ever force this
entrenched camp he is thinking, and before death
takes him he will win another great victory for his
master, King Louis. Northwards of Fontenoy is
where he mostly prefers to stay, for this is the critical
place where by a miracle the French position may be
turned, and here he holds the Maison du Roi and his
reserves in leash. Those English are such stubborn
devils when they are in the stomach for a tussle at hand
grips. We must be ready even for miracles.</p>

<p>An hour—another passed. The Chevalier emerges
from the drifting smoke with welcome news.</p>

<p>“The Austrians and Dutch are retiring,” he says.
“Can you not hear their drums beating to re-form?
Down there we have handled them so roughly that
they have sought cover, huddled behind Bourgeon.
Their horse is broken and tumbled up, and the plain
is littered with their dead. They won’t trouble us
much more.”</p>

</figure>

<p>“It will be the same here, worse luck,” St. Benôit
grumbled. “Those cursed artillerymen are to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
all the honours to-day. We shall not be wanted at
all.”</p>

<p>“Do not be too sure,” André said quietly. And the
Chevalier nodded in agreement before he spurred off
to carry a message to the King, who with Monsieur le
Dauphin is watching the fight near the Hermitage of
Notre Dame des Bois.</p>

<p>Boom! boom! on our front at last. Those are the
English field-pieces beginning to reply to the salute we
have been lavishly doling out. They fire well, those
English artillerymen, and their shots come plumping
into the entrenchments and crashing into the forest.
The men begin to drop in the first line.</p>

<p>“Look at that fool De Grammont,” André muttered,
pointing with his sword.</p>

<p>An officer on a white charger was galloping to and
fro in front of his regiment of guards, encouraging
them in this gallant madcap fashion to keep steady
under the ever-increasing fire.</p>

<p>“By God! he’s down,” he exclaimed as he saw
the white horse stumble and fall, struck by a six-pounder;
and friendly arms are carrying his shattered
rider dying to the rear.</p>

<p>“Poor De Grammont!” said St. Benôit, wiping
away a tear, “never again will his hot-headed chivalry
lead us into a devil’s trap as at Dettingen.”</p>

<p>And he was right. De Grammont, who had ruined
a French army on the Maine, had fought his last fight
that morning, for a cannon-ball had smashed his thigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Drums! English drums!” André cried excitedly.
“They are advancing—can’t you hear ’em? We may
be needed—thank God! we may be needed now.”</p>

<p>Below and across the roar of the guns, through the
dirty smoke blended with the last wisps of the pearly
mist, throbs in a glorious challenge the solemn tuck of
English drums and the marching call of English
trumpets. They are coming on now. Can we not see
the flutter of English colours and the flash of light on
epaulet and sword?</p>

<p>“A noble sight that!” muttered St. Benôit with a
catch in his throat.</p>

<p>“They are fit for gentlemen to cross swords with,”
said the generous André. “I hope they’ll last till we
can meet them as they deserve.”</p>

<p>Through the smoke they could both make out how
the cavalry had fallen to the rear and the infantry was
calmly advancing across the plain in two long lines
with the Hanoverians stepping out on their left.
Aligned as on the parade ground, never halting, never
hurrying, shoulder to shoulder, not a falter, not a
wrinkle, the great red column in two long lines comes
on to the music of its drums; to-day these English
dogs will achieve the impossible if they can. But can
they? Surely not. From Fontenoy shriek the cannons,
from Eu roar our guns, taking them in flank
and in front; there are gaps in the files—they close; a
hideous rent—it is sealed up; like a great scarlet wave
they roll on majestic in irresistible silence. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
can stop them, not all the guns in Europe—marching
on, marching on, marching on unreasoning, dogged,
straight into the throats of our artillery and the muzzles
of our muskets, mad—mad—mad, but the madness
that intoxicates the heart and ennobles the soul.
Dutch and Austrians have twice faced this hellish fire
and twice recoiled, but these English will come on;
they said they would storm the entrenchments on the
left, and get to them they will, for a promise is a promise,
and they have English gentlemen to lead them.</p>

<p>For a time they are lost in the smoke and the roar
and the gentle folds of the slope.</p>

<p>“They are broken,” cried St. Benôit. “Well, they
did their best, but it’s a pity——”</p>

<p>“Broken! by God!” burst out André, “look there—they’ve
done it—done it—and——”</p>

<p>A cry has risen from the French ranks, a cry of
rage and dismay and surprise.</p>

<p>The smoke had suddenly lifted, cut asunder by the
flashes of the guns, and it revealed a superb spectacle.
Not a hundred yards from the entrenchments, right
across our left front almost on the top of the slope,
have suddenly emerged into sight the grim faces of
those serried red lines. The English infantry are on us—actually
on us! Hoarse commands, repeated, a
quiver, they have halted, the drums still placidly
beating, colours gently flapping, while the officers
calmly re-dress their battalions.</p>

<p>A frenzied moment, for behind on the slope here it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
our footmen’s first real sight of them, and Swiss
Guards, Gardes Françaises, the regiments of Courtin,
Aubeterre, and of the King are hurried, dashed, into
order. What are we waiting for? Keep cool for God’s
sake! We have got to fight for it now. This is going
to be a serious affair.</p>

<p>And then a touch to stir the blood. An English
officer has quietly stepped forward—it is my Lord
Charles Hay. Politely he doffs his hat to the French
lines and raises his flask as a man drinks a health at
a banquet. “Gentlemen,” he cries in French, “I
hope you will wait for us to-day and will not swim the
Scheldt as you swam the Maine at Dettingen.” A
dozen angry voices go up in bitter protest at the taunt,
and here, in the third line, we Chevau-légers de la
Garde grip our swords in ferocious wrath. My lord
turns round. “Men of the King’s Company,” his
voice rings out, “here,” he points with his cane, and
waves his hat, “here are the French Guards. You
are going to beat them to-day,” and at once rolls up
in a tumultuous cresendo the thunder of an English
cheer, drowning the orders of the French officers,
quelling the tornado of the guns. Again and again
it surges through the columns, that challenge as of
blooded hounds on the quarry at bay.</p>

<p>“For what we are about to receive,” André heard
an English officer call out, waving towards the French
muskets, “may the Lord make us truly thankful,”
and the cheer melts into a gay, grim laugh, cut short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
by a hideous volley, for the Swiss Guards have fired
straight into the column at thirty paces distance.
Down go red-coats by the dozen, but they remain unshaken.
A minute to draw breath, and the turn of
the English dogs is come at last. No more marching
now; it will be bullet for bullet—and then the bayonet.</p>

<p>Fire! The command runs along from battalion to
battalion. Fire!</p>

<p>André and St. Benôit in the third line wept with
wrath and despair. The English volleys are devilish,
murderous, horrible, and delivered as calmly, silently,
majestically, as they had marched. The red lines are
girt about with a halo of impenetrable flame, pitiless,
ceaseless, triumphant. The Swiss Guards are decimated,
the Courtinois are piled in dying heaps, the
French Guards shattered. Hotter and hotter it grows
as the smoke becomes thicker. Step by step the red
lines advance.</p>

<p>André straining forward can see the stony faces, the
loading and reloading as at a battue, the officers walking
serenely up and down, marking each volley, now
jesting, now reprimanding, now encouraging, now
smartly tapping the muskets with their canes to force
them down and make the men fire low, and fire low
they do. Can nothing be done? The Royal Brigade,
the Soissonois are brought up. Forward now in God’s
name and for the honour of France! Useless, utterly
useless. Volley upon volley shivers the advancing
files; they tumble in bloody swathes; they stop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
recoil, reel. Disorder is spreading, shouts and cries
and the pile of dead grow bigger, and yard by yard to
those infernal drums roll on the red lines. They are
past the earthworks. On they come—a volley—on—on—steady,
slow, irresistible. Ten minutes more and
we are lost!</p>

<p>Fierce trumpets through the smoke, the thunder of
cavalry charging. The Maréchal has launched them,
and not a moment too soon. The English halt—wait—fire.
Horses and men crumble up—dissolve. No
matter. Bring up the second line and now ride home,
ride home. Shame on you that twelve battalions of
infantry backed by artillery can defy the flower of our
French army. The English line shivers into a bristling
wall. Keep quiet there and reserve your fire—muttered
whispers and curses, and then the flame
leaps out. That is the way, sirs; stand up to them and
for heaven’s name let the drums keep beating, the
drums that beat at Dettingen and are beating now at
Fontenoy. Rank after rank totters, breaks, parts,
scatters. A cheer rolls up, the cheers of the victors,
for dying men and riderless horses are all that remain
of our second line of cavalry.</p>

<p>The English have won! No, by God and the Virgin,
the patron of France, not yet! We still remain, we
the Maison du Roi and we the Chevau-légers de la
Garde. The silver trumpets blare out their warning
challenge. One solemn minute—clear your sword
arms and charge! Charge!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Boot to boot, saddle to saddle, through the smoke
we cut our way with set teeth and sobbing breath.
We are no <i>bourgeoisie</i>, we; no <i>canaille</i> or <i>roturiers</i>
drawn from the plough; we are nobles all, and this
will be the cold steel of the white arm at close grips.
The ground is thick with dead—our horses nostrils
gleam red—God! we are on them and the blast of the
tornado smites us and we—we reel! As hail from a
north-easter smites a standing crop so do their bullets
smite us and we stagger like drunken men, stagger
and blench and fail. Red are their coats, but red and
hot as the flames of hell is their fire, and in five awful
minutes we too are left sobbing in the saddle, beaten—beaten!
The chivalry of France has gone down
before that pitiless furnace.</p>

<p>André found himself swept to the rear in the hideous
backwash of that miserable recoil, spattered with
blood, choked with smoke. Gasping he galloped to
the Maréchal.</p>

<p>“The day is lost,” he shouted, “lost!”</p>

<p>The Maréchal nodded as he calmly sucked his leaden
bullet.</p>

<p>“Go,” he replied, “do you go and warn the King
to retire. At least save His Majesty.”</p>

<p>And then he turned to summon his last reserves for
one final effort to retrieve the day while André delivered
his message. But Louis would not retire.
Impenetrable as ever, inspired by a gleam of kingly
pride, he doggedly refused to obey, and André in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
despair left him to rally and lead the infantry and
horse that still remained. Better now death than dishonour,
for a prisoner he would not be a second time.
Back to the fray and fall before defeat comes!</p>

<p>The Chevalier met him as he plunged once more
into the smoke, the thunder of the captains and the
shouting. “The tide has turned!” the young man
cried, “the Austrians and the Dutch have retired. It
is only the English now. This way, Vicomte, this
way!”</p>

<p>The Maréchal had grasped the fact. Dutch and
Austrians had made a second effort on their right and
centre and it had failed. The English were alone, and
with consummate coolness he played his last card.
Guns, horses, men, are feverishly brought up from
Fontenoy, and while the Irish brigade, six battalions
strong, men once British subjects but now fighting for
France, Jacobites, Papists, loyal and disloyal alike,
fugitives, and renegades, gentlemen, thieves, adventurers,
and footpads—men fighting not for honour or
victory but for their necks—are hurled at the red lines,
the broken infantry are rallied, the cavalry re-formed.
The gayest libertine in France, the Duc de Richelieu,
gathers the scattered companies. The King and the
Dauphin are rallying the Maison du Roi.</p>

<p>See! the English are falling back. With sullen
reluctance the order has been given—with sullen reluctance
it is obeyed. Retire they must or die here to
the last man. Step by step, yard by yard, reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
to half its numbers, the red column with drums still
beating just when victory was in its grasp slowly halts—fires—retires.
As they had advanced, so do they retreat,
those English dogs, shoulder to shoulder, files
beautifully dressed, in all the cool majesty of the parade ground,
firing those terrible volleys to the end.</p>

<p>Led by the King to the charge once again does the
Maison du Roi spur furiously to break them; once
again as the island rocks hurl back the invading waves
do the English columns rend them asunder. Not all
the cavalry and infantry of France can mar or shake
that glorious red line. And we can do no more. Let
them go. Into the smoke and down the blood-stained
slopes they glide and vanish. It is enough—enough!</p>

<p>The battle is over. We have won—yes, we have
won, for the camp and the entrenchments are once
more ours and Tournay will fall. Fontenoy is and
will remain a victory for France, but 6000 English
dead and wounded and 10,000 French piled on the
crest and on these awful ridges bear witness to what a
victory it has been. And we French noblemen who
have lived through the morning hours of May 11th
may well take off our hats to the English and Hanoverian
infantry who unsupported—nay, deserted by
their allies—marched into a French camp across an
open plain and all but wrested victory from twice their
numbers. To-morrow the bells of Notre Dame and
a hundred churches will ring for the success of Fontenoy,
but to-night the British drums that beat on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
these slopes will beat in our ears and for ever through
the centuries their deathless challenge to the homage
of chivalry in the hearts of all who call themselves
soldiers. No; we do not grudge them their triumph,
for there are things finer than victory, and that honour
is theirs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>André, marvellously untouched, found St. Benôit
lying by his dead horse half under the wheel of a dismounted
gun on the top of the slope. This was where
the English Guards had turned to bay for the last
time, when the final furious charge that had failed had
been made by the Maison du Roi. St. Benôit had a
bullet through one arm and a bayonet thrust in his
thigh, but thank God he still lived, and André carried
him to his coach with the help of the Chevalier, who
with a tender care strange to his pert <i>insouciance</i> was
doing what he could for the fallen.</p>

<p>“He will live!” said the Chevalier as they returned
to the spot to seek for others, and plenty there were
heaped amongst the Swiss Guards and the Gardes
Françaises, nobles, his friends and comrades, in all
the gay bravery of their blood-stained ruffles and
haughty uniforms, and mostly dead. The strippers of
the camp were already at work on their ghastly trade.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the Chevalier suddenly, for
André had uttered a cry of pain. Only an English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
officer of the 1st Foot Guards, fresh-coloured, smiling,
handsome, lying at his feet amidst a score of common
English rank and file. His sword was not drawn, but
in his hand was a small cane. He had been re-dressing
the line of his company as they had halted to receive
and repulse that last charge.</p>

<p>“It is Captain Statham,” André explained. “I
knew him in England, and—” he checked himself
to stoop. “Yes, he is dead. It is strange.”</p>

<p>“Strange?” questioned the Chevalier.</p>

<p>But André had nothing more to say. The Chevalier
looked very seriously at him and then at the dead
man. A shiver went through him. “Shall we say a
prayer for his soul?” he asked in a hurried, low voice.</p>

<p>André assented in no little surprise, and together
they repeated a hasty prayer, and then André carried
him away. He could not leave him—this English
officer—to the awful mercies of the harpies who preyed
on the gallant dead.</p>

<p>“I have had enough of this,” were the Chevalier’s
words as they parted, and his gay face was sick. And
André had had enough too.</p>

<p>And that night as he munched his supper there was
but one thought in his mind. Perhaps an English
Denise and an English mother were now on their
knees awaiting the news from Fontenoy; but they
would never know that last night the son and lover
had gone to the cabin of the charcoal-burner and had
by an accident seen the face of the masked woman who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
had striven to betray the French army. To-day Captain
Statham, as so many others, had fallen in the performance
of his duty. Was that fate or the chance of
war? Who could say? With a shudder he recalled
the grim words of the little <i>vivandière</i> who had disappeared.
But one thing was certain. Whatever secret
Captain Statham had learned—if it was a secret—his
lips would never reveal it now. And had he, André
de Nérac, seen that woman’s face he, too, perhaps,
had been found lying where the dead were thickest.
“No. 101!” And had he done with “No. 101”?
Assuredly not, assuredly not.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>IN THE SALON DE LA PAIX AT VERSAILLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mon Dieu!</span> my dear Abbé,” exclaimed the Comtesse
des Forges, dropping her cards to let her languishing,
heavy-lidded eyes linger on the smiling face of her
latest <i>protégé</i>, “you make my blood run cold.”</p>

<p>“<i>Brélan de rois</i>” called the plump Duchesse de
Pontchartrain, carefully noting the fact on her tablets
before she allowed her suspicions to master her.
“But are you quite sure?”</p>

<p>The dandy Abbé St. Victor with the air of a connoisseur
compared the Venus on the cover of his snuff-box
with the delicately-tinted shoulders of her grace.</p>

<p>“As sure,” he said slowly, “as Madame the Dauphine
is dead, rest her poor German soul, and that
Monsieur the Dauphin will marry again.”</p>

<p>It was Sunday evening a good year after Fontenoy.
The Court was just out of mourning, to its great joy,
and the Salon de la Paix at Versailles blazed with
lights and with the jewels and silks of a brilliant
throng, a few of whom were dispersed in groups making
love or talking scandal over their chocolate, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the greater part were playing cards, the ladies at the
fashionable <i>brélan</i>, the men at the dice which led to
duels and mortgaged estates.</p>

<p>“It will be the deuce for the peace negotiations,”
Philippe Comte de Mont Rouge remarked, scowling at
the Abbé for no other reason than that he was condemned
to sit at this table while Denise, the favourite
of the Queen’s maids of honour, was talking in
an alcove behind his back to the Chevalier de St.
Amant.</p>

<p>“Go you, my dear Abbé,” said the Comtesse, “and
bring Des Forges and St. Benôit here. Your news
will excite them more than throwing three sixes
running.”</p>

<p>“And,” added the Duchess in her pouting staccato,
“put your head into the gallery yonder, dear friend,
and see if my husband has finished his flirtation with
that pretty wench of mine.”</p>

<p>“And if he hasn’t, Duchess?”</p>

<p>“Give them a plenary absolution and let them begin
all over again,” interposed the Comtesse.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” the Duchess assented plaintively,
“it will keep them both out of worse mischief. Really
I cannot dismiss the girl. She washes my lace to perfection.”
And she resettled the delicate trimming on
her corsage for the benefit of the Comte de Mont
Rouge.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” St. Benôit demanded.</p>

<p>The Abbé took a fresh pinch of snuff. “The messenger,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
he said with no little excitement, “the
messenger who was conveying secret instructions from
the King to the army in Flanders was found last night
in a ditch near Vincennes drugged, his arms and feet
bound, and——”</p>

<p>“The despatches gone?”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>The Comte des Forges meditatively licked his signet
ring. “I knew something d-dreadful had hap-happened,”
he stammered. “Why ever should I only be
able to t-throw twos to-to-night?”</p>

<p>“What do you make of that?” asked Mont Rouge.</p>

<p>St. Benôit appeared to study his uniform of the
Chevau-légers de la Garde in the mirror. His eye
rested on Denise and her companion. “The second
time in the last three months,” he muttered. “What
does the courier say?”</p>

<p>“Say,” repeated the Comtesse des Forges, “say!
Not a word, you may swear. The fool knows nothing
till he woke to find a gag in his mouth and two peasants
glaring at him as if he were the devil.”</p>

<p>“Pontchartrain,” remarked the Duchess, “is sure
the man fell in with a siren at the cabaret where he
had his supper. Pontchartrain knows most of the
cabarets and all the sirens.”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait,” pursued the Abbé. “The courier
was carrying not merely army despatches, but,” his
voice dropped, “a private cipher message from His
Majesty to the agent of the Jacobites.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>St. Benôit so forgot the etiquette of the Salon de la
Paix as to whistle softly.</p>

<p>“B-by Jove!” stammered Des Forges.</p>

<p>“They say,” whispered the Abbé to his enthralled
audience, “that the message was an invitation to
Prince Charles Edward to ignore the King’s explicit
promise to the English ambassador and to present himself
at Versailles.”</p>

<p>“Dear Prince!” exclaimed the Duchess. “If only
he would come to Court I believe I could make Pontchartrain
jealous and still have my lace washed by
Françoise.”</p>

<p>“I should kiss him, yes I should kiss him, the royal
hero. You agree, Des Forges?” cried the Comtesse.
“The English—pah! I would do anything to spite
the English for their treachery to their lawful Prince.”</p>

<p>“But your kisses, <i>ma mie</i>,” replied her husband,
“w-would only keep the P-prince from g-going again
to seek his c-crown.”</p>

<p>“Pray what does the Comte des Forges know of
madame’s kisses?” asked the Duchess innocently,
and they all laughed, no one more heartily than the
Comtesse herself.</p>

<p>“And this is serious,” said St. Benôit, “even more
serious than the kisses of Madame la Comtesse.”</p>

<p>“And the King is really angry,” the Comtesse said.
“M. d’Argenson came away from his audience this
morning looking as if he had stolen the despatches
himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“And His Majesty remained on his knees at mass
ten minutes after every one else had risen,” said the
Abbé; “he always does when he is thoroughly angry.”</p>

<p>“I told you it would play the devil with the peace
negotiations,” Mont Rouge commented.</p>

<p>“It is curious,” mused St. Benôit, “very curious
that this infernal treason should begin again just when
the Chevalier de St. Amant has returned to his duties.”</p>

<p>“The Chevalier?” they all questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the night before Fontenoy,” St.
Benôit continued, “when our friend André de Nérac
saved the army from foul treachery? Well, I never
could get the whole truth from him, but he allowed me
to infer that the Chevalier was playing a very fishy
part in the business.”</p>

<p>“Impossible,” protested the Duchess. “The Chevalier
is on our side—the Queen’s side—the right
side.”</p>

<p>“The Marquise de Beau Séjour, I suppose,” sneered
the Comtesse, “is guarantee for that.”</p>

<p>“That is not worthy of you, dear lady,” St. Benôit
corrected gently, looking into her great blue eyes as
he had looked twelve months ago. “Mademoiselle de
Beau Séjour is Mademoiselle de Beau Séjour. It will
take more than a parvenu Italian chevalier to make her
forget she is of the same quality and sex as the Comtesse
des Forges. But I would wager a diamond bracelet
to a sou that either the Chevalier is at the bottom
of this dirty business—or,” he delicately sniffed at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
lace handkerchief as one who feared infection, “or that
woman.”</p>

<p>“Poisson-Pompadour, a fishy grisette,” sniggered
Des Forges, playing on the name, “at the b-bottom of
a f-fishy business—eh?”</p>

<p>“The Abbé can give us news again,” remarked
Mont Rouge sweetly. “He attended the grisette’s
toilet this morning.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” the Comtesse exclaimed with sincere
anger.</p>

<p>“He blushes, our dear friend,” pursued the remorseless
Mont Rouge, “blushes a rose de Pompadour.
Ha! ha!” The hit went home. Rose de Pompadour
was the new colour invented in honour of the King’s
favourite at the world-famed royal manufactory at
Sèvres.</p>

<p>“The Duc de Pontchartrain was there too,” retorted
the Abbé sulkily.</p>

<p>“That,” pouted the Duchess, “is a worse insult to
me than if——”</p>

<p>“Than what, <i>ma mignonne</i>?” blandly inquired his
Grace, who had stolen in upon the group. “I would
have you know, ladies, that in a white peignoir, with
her hair about her bare shoulders, the Marquise de
Pompadour is the prettiest woman save one at Versailles,
or Paris for that matter.”</p>

<p>“Every one,” laughed the Abbé, “knows that Monsieur
le Duc is a connoisseur of painting.”</p>

<p>“And the name of the other divine grisette?” asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the Comtesse roguishly, for the Duke was studying
her as he studied the <i>coryphées</i> of the opera or his
race-horses.</p>

<p>The Duke kissed the plump fingers of his wife with
the most charming grace imaginable. “The mirror
will answer Madame la Duchesse,” quoth he.</p>

<p>“But my peignoir is blue,” she protested, “and
even Françoise could tell you my shoulders on such
occasions never are bare.”</p>

<p>“The more’s the pity.” St. Benôit bowed to the
diamonds on her breast.</p>

<p>“Amen!” droned the Abbé in the officiating priest’s
sing-song, and the Duchess dimpled with delight.</p>

<p>“The Abbé has not told you,” said the Duke, “how
he sat on the f-fishy grisette’s bed. He is a bold man
our spiritual friend. Listen. There were we all at
madame’s toilet this morning—charming shoulders she
has I repeat—and kept standing on our feet were we,
for she is royal now is the Marquise, and no one may
have a chair.”</p>

<p>“The insolence of the jade,” cried the Comtesse.
“That Versailles should endure it!”</p>

<p>“And presently strides in the King. No chair for
him either. <i>Parbleu!</i> My legs were breaking and so
apparently were the Abbé’s. Presently I heard a
crack, and there had our witty friend plumped himself
down right on Madame’s bed. ‘With your permission,
sire,’ he said with a comic cock of his eye, ‘but I am
dead tired.’ And the King, who had come in as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
sulky as a bear, burst into laughter. ‘Look, Madame,’
he said, ‘look at this poor devil of an Abbé!’”</p>

<p>“And the Pompadour?”</p>

<p>“She shrugged her bare shoulders and laughed too,
because the King was amused, but she put back her
ears, very pretty ears, by the way, like a vicious horse.
My faith! she will not forget ‘this poor devil of an
Abbé.’”</p>

<p>“My friend, I could embrace you,” cried the
Duchess.</p>

<p>“If you would only do it again,” said the Comtesse,
“I would embrace you, too.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember De Nérac’s prophecy,” St.
Benôit asked quietly, “that if that woman came to
Versailles she would come to stay?”</p>

<p>“Ah! if only some one would poison her,” murmured
the Duchess.</p>

<p>“Or another take her place,” cried the Comtesse.</p>

<p>“For the good of the country,” interposed the
Duke, “I am quite ready to sacrifice the Duchess, even
though she——”</p>

<p>“This is no jesting matter,” St. Benôit interrupted
sharply. “The Queen and the ministers know that
unless we can ruin this jade of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> France
and we will be ruined. I wish to heaven André de
Nérac were here instead of risking his life in Flanders
to no purpose than the glory of the Pompadour.”</p>

<p>“A miracle, a miracle!” cried the Duchess, pointing
with her fan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>At the end of the salon a little knot of excited
courtiers had gathered, and in their midst stood the
Vicomte de Nérac.</p>

<p>For a minute or two he halted, gazing about him
with a slightly dazed air. The brilliant lights, the
jewels and bare shoulders of the ladies, the uniforms
and stars of the men, the rattle of the dice and the
clatter of a hundred idle tongues seemed to awe him,
familiar though he was with the scene. It was pleasant
in this heavily-perfumed air with the flash of the
candelabra on his riding cloak, faded uniform, and
dusty boots, and on his tanned face, to mark the
singularly bracing and vivid contrast that he presented
to the luxurious idlers of his world. His eye had
fallen on Denise. His shoulders straightened, his lips
tightened, unconsciously.</p>

<p>“Depend on it,” St. Benôit whispered to the Duke.
“André’s appearance has something to do with this
damnable treachery.”</p>

<p>“Or,” added the Duke quietly, “with the schemes
of that fishy grisette. The post of the master of her
household is vacant.”</p>

<p>André was soon basking in the smiles of his lady
friends, proud to welcome a hero who had saved an
army of France. Ten minutes showed that he knew
nothing of the mysterious affair at Vincennes, and he
could only repeat that he had been summoned to
Versailles by the express commands of his Sovereign.
Why and for what he was ignorant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>The ladies in particular as they babbled watched
him closely. Eighteen months of campaigning had
not robbed his smile of its charm nor his dark eyes of
their eloquent reserve. He was still the André de
Nérac who had made more husbands jealous, more
women rivals, than even the Duc de Richelieu. For
Mademoiselle Claire, for Mademoiselle Eugénie, and
the other maids of honour he had a bow and the
finished compliment so dear to Versailles; he had even
a friendly nod for the Chevalier de St. Amant. But
to Denise’s curtsey a cold and correct salute in silence
was all he deigned to reply. The rebuke made the
eyes of the Comtesse des Forges very bright; indeed,
it set the Salon de la Paix gossiping when he withdrew
to remove the stains of his hard riding.</p>

<p>“This will ruin everything,” St. Benôit muttered,
for he had both fears and plans in his head. So that
when André and Denise suddenly met in the half-lights
of the empty gallery neither knew the meeting
was due to a friendly schemer.</p>

<p>The quick flush in Denise’s cheeks (she ravished
the gay blades of Versailles by scorning powder
and paint), the dropping of her grey eyes, sent a
thrill into the soldier’s heart, but he kept a resolute
silence.</p>

<p>“Madame your mother,” Denise began with an
effort, “will be proud to welcome you back. Do you
stay long at Versailles?” she added hurriedly, when
he simply bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“I do not know, Mademoiselle; I await His Majesty’s
commands.”</p>

<p>“You are perhaps sorry to return?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell—yet,” he replied with slow emphasis.</p>

<p>Denise flashed an inquiring glance. “What you
will find here,” she said hurriedly, “cannot please a
noble of France. A neglected and dishonoured queen—an
adventuress——”</p>

<p>“We are in the King’s hands,” André interrupted
with a dry smile.</p>

<p>“Yes. Versailles, France, are in the King’s hands,”
she repeated despairingly. “Ah!” she cried with a
sudden flash, “we want all who would help to—to—”
the words died away under the chill of his demeanour.</p>

<p>“To banish the Marquise de Pompadour?” he inquired
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Yes. There will be no peace nor honour for
France until the Queen, my mistress, is restored to her
place and that woman ceases to traffic in the affairs of
a great kingdom.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you are right, Mademoiselle. Perhaps
it is your business. It certainly is not mine.”</p>

<p>“Not yours? Why not? Are you not one of us, a
soldier, a noble?”</p>

<p>“Doubtless, but,” he shrugged his shoulders, “I at
least cannot forget that a worthless libertine——”</p>

<p>“I had hoped you had forgotten those words; you
are cruel,” she interrupted, “you who have shown——”</p>

<p>“Say no more,” he exclaimed joyfully. “I <i>have</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
forgotten and I ask you to forgive. I was rude as well
as cruel. Yes, I have come back as I swore I would
to prove that I might be worthy of your regard, your
love, Denise.”</p>

<p>He gently touched her hand and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>“Of my love,” she said quietly, “you must not
speak, if you please. But my regard you have already
won in Flanders. And, André,” she continued earnestly,
“there is work for you to do here. You will
help us—us who would—ah!”</p>

<p>She broke off sharply, for one of the ushers of the
King’s bed-chamber had swiftly come upon them.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte,” he said, “His Majesty desires
you to wait upon him at once in the salon of
Madame la Marquise de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>“But—” André looked at his travel-stained cloak
and boots.</p>

<p>“His Majesty desired Monsieur le Vicomte to attend
just as he was.”</p>

<p>“Adieu,” Denise whispered, “and do not forget to-night
that you are a noble and soldier of France.”</p>

<p>André turned angrily to obey, for the message from
those pleading grey eyes had stirred all the fierce pride
of his class. Confound this <i>bourgeoise</i> woman who
ordered nobles to dance attendance in her salon!</p>

<p>“I will not forget, Denise,” he whispered back and
his spurs rang defiance on the staircase which led to
the second floor, where the favourite so loathed by the
Court held sway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A ROYAL GRISETTE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur le Vicomte de Nérac</span>,” pronounced
the gentleman-usher closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>The King was leaning against the mantelpiece talking
to Madame de Pompadour smiling from an arm-chair
up at him. The bored, impenetrable royal eyes
travelled over André’s figure as he advanced to kneel
and kiss his Sovereign’s hand. Madame then without
rising held out hers, and André, conscious only of the
King’s presence, must swallow his pride and salute as
she sat this upstart usurper of royal honours. But
the blood of the De Néracs boiled within him.</p>

<p>Louis gazed with lazy approval round the apartment
furnished with even greater taste than wealth, at the
costly books and pictures, at the unfinished plaster
cast which Madame had been modelling, at the plans
of buildings littered on a glorious escritoire. A Mæcenas
in petticoats, whatever else she was, this adventuress,
thought André as he waited in silence, and he
recalled the memories of the salon she had held as
Madame d’Étiolles for Voltaire, the President Hénault,
the Abbé de Bernis, and the other famous wits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Madame la Marquise,” said the King abruptly,
“will convey my wishes. Good-night, Vicomte.”</p>

<p>The curtains at the other end of the room had
scarcely fallen on the departing King when the lady
resumed her seat as if she desired the standing André
clearly to recognise that the King’s presence made no
difference to the rights she claimed. It was, too, as
if she insolently invited him to inspect her. And inspect
her he did, tingling all the time with rage.</p>

<p>How she looked Nattier and La Tour, who painted
her in the heyday of her womanhood and of her beauty,
have left on immortal record. And anger could not
prevent André’s heart, so susceptible to feminine loveliness,
from a swift thrill of homage. That dainty head,
the exquisite shape and pose of her neck, those wonderful
eyes, now black, now blue, now grey, that bust
called by a poet <i>les parfaits plaisirs</i>, the harmony of
her heliotrope robe, lace-edged with cunning artlessness—every
line, every detail, witnessed to a woman’s
magic insight into the handiwork of God. And here
in this haughty Versailles, where taste, breeding, and
birth were superior to mere beauty, this woman, born
a <i>bourgeoise</i>, had by some diabolic witchery usurped
the polished ease so justly regarded as the heritage and
the monopoly of the château and of the <i>noblesse</i>.</p>

<p>She had risen. “Monsieur le Vicomte,” André
noted the musical modulation in her voice, “His Majesty
has been pleased to confer on you the fit reward of
your valour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>She was gravely offering him the soldier’s and statesman’s
most coveted distinction, the Cordon Bleu. The
blood leaped into André’s head. For a moment the
room swam blue as the ribbon. “Madame, I thank
you,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“It is the King’s gift,” she corrected calmly.
For a minute or two they surveyed each other.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she demanded of the servant who had
entered.</p>

<p>“The superintendent of police awaits the commands
of Madame la Marquise.”</p>

<p>“Let him enter,” she said, resuming her seat and
quietly ignoring André.</p>

<p>His anger grew hot again as he observed how she
took for granted the official’s humble obedience.</p>

<p>“Study that lampoon,” she said, tossing him a fly-sheet.
“You must discover the author and have him
punished.”</p>

<p>“But it is impossible, Madame,” the superintendent
replied after a pause. “I have no power to arrest,
still less to punish, the ladies and gentlemen of
Versailles.”</p>

<p>“It comes from the palace, then?”</p>

<p>“It does not come from Paris,” the official answered
drily.</p>

<p>She placed the paper in a drawer. For a few seconds
the look in her eyes was terrible. “You have the
other information I required?” she asked.</p>

<p>“His Majesty last night was closeted with his private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
secretaries till half-past ten. At a quarter to eleven
His Majesty walked in the north gallery with the
Chevalier de St. Amant. At eleven they met the
Marquise de Beau Séjour leaving her Majesty’s apartments.
The Chevalier spoke to her, the King did not.
At ten minutes past eleven His Majesty went to bed.”</p>

<p>André went cold as ice at the glib report. Denise
was right. There would be no peace till this woman
had been hunted from her place.</p>

<p>“Good. That will do,” and she dismissed the
official. Then she turned her chair.</p>

<p>“The post of master of my household is vacant,”
she said. “It is the King’s pleasure that it be filled
by the Vicomte de Nérac.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, Madame?” André questioned
haughtily.</p>

<p>She calmly repeated the sentence, looking him full
in the face.</p>

<p>“It is impossible,” he answered, with difficulty
restraining his anger.</p>

<p>“Nothing that the King of France is pleased to command
a subject can be impossible,” she rejoined almost
sweetly.</p>

<p>André clenched his hands and held his tongue. A
gentleman must needs accept an insult even from a
low-born woman with the dignity due to himself.</p>

<p>“It is the King’s pleasure,” she proceeded with a
flash of sarcasm, “but it is not mine. I do not
choose to accept the services of the Vicomte de Nérac.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>André gave her a look. Had she been a man she
might have lived twenty-four hours, certainly no more.</p>

<p>“Has Monsieur le Vicomte any further observations
to offer? No? Then—” she made the pretence of
a curtsey. He, André de Nérac, a Croix of St. Louis
and a Cordon Bleu, was dismissed.</p>

<p>An icy bow; he was striding to the door.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte leaves the Cordon Bleu on
the table,” she remarked, but André in his rage paid
no heed.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” a caressing laugh caused him to halt
with a shiver. “<i>Mon Dieu!</i> so you have forgotten the
little <i>vivandière</i> at Fontenoy? Ah, well, it is no
matter.”</p>

<p>André drew a deep breath. The past swept into his
eyes. Was he bewitched or——</p>

<p>“But I have not forgotten,” came that silvery voice,
“see the proof,” she was holding up the Cordon Bleu.</p>

<p>“It was you—who,” he sat down overcome.</p>

<p>“To be sure. Who else? I am a good actress, am
I not? Ah, yes, the world knows I can act. Paint
and powder, a red jacket, a short petticoat with boots
half-way to the knees. Would they not stare in the
Galerie des Glaces if they knew?” She tripped
towards him, head cocked on one side, hands on her
hips. “The Vicomte will not betray our secret for all
his wrath. ‘It is impossible, Madame, impossible,’”
she was mimicking divinely his haughty brevity.
“Ah! you will forgive the <i>vivandière</i> though you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
cannot forgive the Marquise de Pompadour. Yes, you
did me a service that night for which I have repaid you
by an insult. I ask your pardon, for I am grateful.”</p>

<p>In her pleading eyes floated a wonderful tenderness
and penitence.</p>

<p>“And every minute,” she pursued softly, “I felt
sure you must recognise me. But you did not. My
faith! soldiers are strange, so proud and fierce and
stupid—eh? But you frightened me, upon my honour
you did. I tremble still.”</p>

<p>André stumbled to his feet.</p>

<p>“I am in your power,” she whispered. “No one
but you knows that I was at Fontenoy, not even the
King. But all France knows that the Vicomte de
Nérac saved the army, though they have not learned
it was at the bidding of a <i>vivandière</i>,” she nodded, the
corners of her mouth bewitching.</p>

<p>“It is amazing,” he cried, bewildered, “amazing!”</p>

<p>She gently closed the door behind him. “Perhaps,”
she said. “But have you forgotten ‘No. 101’?”</p>

<p>For eighteen months André had not heard a word
of that traitor. His existence had been blotted from
his memory, but now in a flash the scene in the wood
stormed into his mind.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he muttered. “Ah!” One minute of the
past and he was once more back in this dainty salon,
though his anger and pride were melting fast before
the radiant witchery of this strange woman who had
conquered a king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“The treachery of ‘No. 101’ has begun again,” she
was saying quietly. “And it will not stop this time,
I have good reason to believe, unless—I—” she broke
off—“unless——”</p>

<p>Across the memory of the charcoal-burner’s cabin in
the grisly wood rang Denise’s warning. The Cordon
Bleu gleamed at him from the table. And Captain
Statham who had seen the traitor’s face lay dead at
his feet. Madame smiled softly as if she divined the
meaning of those clenched fingers, the lips that formed
a sentence and then were pressed in silence.</p>

<p>Madame briefly recited as the Abbé had done in the
Salon de la Paix the story of the stolen despatches and
the courier’s fate in the ditch at Vincennes. “It is the
second time in three months,” she summed up. “There
will be a third before long.”</p>

<p>“You really think so?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” she replied. “The negotiations
for peace have commenced, but the war still goes on.
This black, infernal treachery is here in Versailles, in
our midst, for the prize to a traitor at this critical time
is worth a king’s ransom. It is maddening, maddening—believe
me, the man or woman who lays bare the
mystery will do the King and France a service never
to be forgotten. And His Majesty can be grateful.”</p>

<p>André’s ambitious heart throbbed responsive to the
skilful touch.</p>

<p>“I mean to discover the traitor. I foiled him at
Fontenoy. I will foil him again, but,” she paused,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
“a woman cannot do it alone. When the King wrote
to me before I came to Versailles, ‘<i>Discret et Fidèle</i>’
was his motto. I want to-day a friend who will be
‘<i>discret et fidèle</i>,’ a man without fear, loyal, ingenious,
and brave.”</p>

<p>André raised his head sharply. The thoughts
were coming fast; he began to see dimly, to hope, to
dream.</p>

<p>“I confess,” she pursued, “that I thought the Vicomte
de Nérac might be that man, my man. But it
is impossible, impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why, Madame?” He was leaning eagerly across
the table.</p>

<p>“Why?” She laughed softly. “Because the Marquise
de Pompadour is a <i>bourgeoise</i>, a heartless, selfish,
intriguing wanton, and she can find many who will
serve her, who will write ballades to her eyes and sonnets
to her bosom, and then behind her back will scribble
the foul libels that the soldiers sang at Fontenoy.
But the Court, the Queen, the Dauphin, the bishops
and priests, the libertines and the <i>dévots</i>, the ministers
and the great ladies are leagued in hate against me.
It is true, is it not?”</p>

<p>And André could not answer.</p>

<p>“So long as I have the King on my side I am safe.
But this palace is a labyrinth of intrigue. If the King
grows weary I shall be fortunate to leave Versailles a
free woman. And by my ruin those of my service
will be ruined too. The task I mean to perform is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
doubly dangerous—there is the Court and there is ‘No.
101.’ Yes, it is no task for the Vicomte de Nérac.”</p>

<p>The gentle voice cut like a whip. André began to
pace up and down.</p>

<p>“You are young, my friend.” She was looking at
him as she had looked when she slipped the pillow
beneath his head at Fontenoy. “You are brave, a
soldier with great ambitions and a great future, for you
have the heart and courage of your race. You are of
the <i>noblesse</i>, your world is not of this salon, but of the
Salon de la Paix. Your friends, your blood, have
declared war upon me; for a traitor to their cause they
will have no mercy. True the King has commanded
your services in my household, but Antoinette d’Étiolles,
who is grateful for what you did at Fontenoy,
refuses to accept because she would not ruin, I cannot
say a friend, but a noble hero of France.”</p>

<p>Remorse, ambition, the witchery of her beauty, his
love for Denise, strove for mastery within him.</p>

<p>“Adieu,” she whispered, “you must go your way,
I mine. We shall meet, perhaps. How long I shall
be here God knows. But trust me, I will see that
your refusal to accept the King’s pleasure shall do you
no harm. You will succeed, you must, for fortune,
birth, and manhood are on your side. Adieu!”</p>

<p>“But, Madame—” he cried impulsively.</p>

<p>“No, Vicomte, no. It is impossible. A man may
sacrifice himself, but never—never must he sacrifice his
love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Her eyes rested on him with sympathetic significance.
She had divined his secret. André felt the
blood scarlet as his uniform in his cheeks. Denise—yes,
Denise blocked the way to the future this enchantress
had dreamed for him, nay, that he had dreamed
for himself.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” he said slowly, raising
her hand to his lips. “But André de Nérac is not
ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she smiled. “Take your Cordon Bleu.
It is none the less deserved because it was asked for
by a <i>vivandière</i>. Will Monsieur le Vicomte permit?
Yes?” she had pinned it to his breast. Her face was
very close to his; the flattery in those wonderful eyes
caressed his inmost soul. “See,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“This way—it is safer for you.”</p>

<p>She lifted the curtain over an alcove revealing a narrow
staircase down to a dark passage. “At the bottom
you will find to the left a door locked; here is the
key. By that private door you can return to the public
galleries. The dark passage leads to the King’s and
the Queen’s private apartments. The King, or indeed
any one who has the key, can come this way unknown
to the spies of the ministers or of the Court. Remember,
there are only two keys; the King has one, this is
the other. Keep it; you may want it.”</p>

<p>“Want it?” he repeated, confused.</p>

<p>“The Vicomte,” she corrected gently, “henceforth
cannot without harming himself visit publicly a <i>bourgeoise</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
grisette. But he will remember that in Antoinette
de Pompadour he has, if he will but believe it, a
true and grateful friend. If he is in trouble or in difficulty
the key will show him the way and no one will
be wiser. If not, it is no matter.”</p>

<p>“But, Madame, why should I be in trouble?”</p>

<p>She laughed mysteriously. “Anything, as the Vicomte
well knows, can happen at Versailles. Adieu!”</p>

<p>And yet she lingered. “The Cordon Bleu was from
the King,” she said; “accept this, pray, from me; it
is the handkerchief, the famous handkerchief of the
Hôtel de Ville, and it comes from my heart.” She
had tossed it to him with an airy kiss blown from her
jewelled fingers.</p>

<p>What a charming picture she made, framed in the
darkness there with her heliotrope robe drawn back to
avoid the dripping of the candle held above her dainty
head. <i>Un morceau de roi, parbleu!</i></p>

<p>“Remember ‘No. 101.’ Adieu.” The soft echo
stole into the chill passage. The Marquise had
dropped the curtain and André was alone with his
thoughts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>WHAT THE VICOMTE DE NÉRAC SAW IN THE SECRET
PASSAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">André</span> sat down on the stairs in the dark. It is
perhaps not surprising that his first thoughts were of
“No. 101.” Across his path had fallen for the second
time the shadow of that baleful, blood-stained mystery.
So far all who had tried to run the traitor to earth had
failed; but when war and peace, the King’s policy
and the destinies of France, hung in the balance success
in the task meant a great reward. That masked
woman in the wood had baffled him. Vanity, a passionate
curiosity, the spell of the mystery, patriotism,
once more united to kindle his longing to succeed
where all had failed. But to attempt it alone or without
money or information was out of the question. To
invite the co-operation of his friends in this Versailles
of intrigue and counter-intrigue, of jealousy and
selfishness, spelled certain failure. With Madame de
Pompadour’s help alone it might be done, but that was
impossible, doubly impossible. Madame was right.
A De Nérac, a Croix de St. Louis, and a Cordon Bleu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
could not enter the service of a <i>bourgeoise</i> favourite,
here to-day and gone to-morrow, could not defy his
class, the Queen and the Court, could not outrage his
own dignity. Denise would spurn him for ever. Sacrifice
his love? no, a thousand times no! Still less
could he return now a suppliant for the Pompadour’s
favours: she who had refused his aid; he who had
scorned her offer. Yet—yes, yet with what delicacy
and sympathy she had atoned for her apparent insolence.
No woman, not Denise herself, could have
shown her gratitude with more grace and conviction.
An adventuress she was maybe, but a true woman for
all that, and as charming as beautiful. Name of a
dog! The faint perfume of that dainty handkerchief,
which had made history, subtly recalled the intoxicating
flattery of her eyes, the tender gratitude of her voice.
The King—André laughed softly—the King was no fool
when he was conquered by Antoinette d’Étiolles. And
he had her key; well, he would see about that key.</p>

<p>His mind travelled to the thought of Denise. He
had sworn to win her; he loved her, his beautiful Marquise
de Beau Séjour, for was she not what the wife of
a De Nérac should be—fair, noble, and pure? The
scandalous tongues of the Court rendered her the
homage of silence. She was the type to him of what
France, the France for which he fought, could be.
Did not there burn in her soul the inspiring flame of
patriotism, duty, and high endeavour which she, as
he, owed to her lineage and to God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>Well, well, to-morrow would bring counsel. He
rose to grope his way to the locked door. <i>Mon Dieu!</i>
What was this?</p>

<p>The door was opening stealthily. Some one was
coming in. The King? Of course. André softly flew
up the stairs and crouched in the folds of the curtain.
If the King was coming to the Pompadour he was lost,
but caught as he was in this dark corridor it was his
only chance of concealment.</p>

<p>A light from a hand lamp flickered into the darkness.
Ah! that was not the King’s step; nor did the King
hum gay songs under his breath. Ho! ho! an adventure!
Madame’s key was worth the owning after all.</p>

<p>As he lived, the Chevalier de St. Amant, a rose between
his lips, hat cocked jauntily, his slim, boyish
figure instinct with an abandoned grace. Pooh! he
was the King’s private secretary and the royal key had
been given him by his master for his own purposes.
This was very interesting and mightily droll.</p>

<p>André drew a deep breath. The door at the top of
the stairs at the other end of the passage had quietly
opened. Some one with a lamp was standing awaiting
the Chevalier. A woman! Yes, the light fell with a
gleam on the folds of her dress, on the jewel on her
breast. The gay young dog to use his royal master’s
key in this way. What adorable audacity!</p>

<p>The woman held up the lamp with a familiar gesture.
Denise! By God it was Denise!</p>

<p>One choking moment and then André turned stone-cold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Denise, his Denise! Mechanically he wiped
the perspiration from his brow as he stared spellbound.
Denise!</p>

<p>The Chevalier doffed his hat, kissed her hand, took
the lamp from her, and once more André was alone in
the darkness, gnawed by impotent and implacable
rage, jealousy black and hot as hell.</p>

<p>But what did it mean—in heaven’s name what did
it mean? And the Chevalier? Ah, if it had not been
his Denise!</p>

<p>Only by the sternest self-control did he prevent himself
from dashing after them. Pure madness, for that
door was certainly locked. He must wait here if he
waited till Doomsday. It seemed an eternity—in
reality it was about half-an-hour—and then the Chevalier
reappeared alone and still jauntily humming his
song stealthily let himself out, ignorant, poor boy, that
only a noble’s refusal to stab in cold blood like a common
footpad had saved him from staining the floor of
this dark corridor with his life’s blood.</p>

<p>Here was a fresh mystery. This cursed Versailles
with its infamies and plots, its libertines and intriguers,
its cabals, cliques, and conspiracies! “No. 101,”
Yvonne, the crystal-gazer, Madame de Pompadour,
war, treachery, and the Chevalier—in what cruel toils
was his life set; but this last was the rudest shock of
all. André could have cried aloud in sheer perplexity
at the riddles that beset him on every side.</p>

<p>He took out the key. The touch of the cool steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
on his feverish fingers sent a thrill through him. Ah!
Madame had given him this key; she had ushered him
out this way. He had wondered why. Because she
was grateful? No. It was clear now—clear as daylight.
She knew the secrets of this hateful corridor
and she desired him to see for himself. Could it be
possible? Yes, yes; it must be. A swift decision
stormed into his mind.</p>

<p>Cautiously he let himself out. The public gallery
was empty, but as he strode towards the stables he
was startled to meet Denise hurrying to the Queen’s
apartments.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, inspecting her closely, “tell me, if
you please, where I can find the Chevalier de St.
Amant?”</p>

<p>Denise gazed at his bronzed, inscrutable face with
astonishment—or was it fear?</p>

<p>“I was informed,” André said carelessly, “that he
had been seen in your company going towards the
King’s apartments—a mistake, no doubt. The Chevalier
is probably with His Majesty. It is a pity, for——”</p>

<p>“But the King,” Denise interrupted hastily, “is not
in his private apartments; neither is the Chevalier
there.”</p>

<p>André calmly studied her. “Ah, Mademoiselle,”
he laughed, “I see you are well informed. I must
seek the Chevalier elsewhere.” He turned away.</p>

<p>“And will you not tell me of what passed—” Denise
had begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“I regret infinitely that I have pressing business,
Mademoiselle. To-morrow, if you will be so kind,”
and he smilingly bid her good-night.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was galloping through the
woods to “The Cock with the Spurs of Gold.” Something
useful for his new resolve might possibly be
learned there, and every clue would help now.</p>

<p>The inn that looked like a farmhouse buried in the
woods wore as deserted an air as it had worn eighteen
months ago, and in answer to his imperious knock
there appeared the chambermaid with the shifty eyes,
who stared in fear and surprise at this officer in his
faded uniform and muddy boots who demanded
entrance in the dark hours of the night.</p>

<p>“My mistress, the wise woman, is not here, sir,”
she replied pettishly, half closing the door in André’s
face.</p>

<p>“When will she be here?”</p>

<p>“Never again, Monsieur. She has left.”</p>

<p>André promptly pushed his way into the passage and
closed the door. The girl uttered a suppressed shriek.
“Are you of the police, sir?” she whimpered. “I
know nothing, nothing; I swear it.”</p>

<p>“I am not of the police,” he said quietly. “I am a
friend of your mistress. See that gold piece; you shall
have it if you will tell me all you know.”</p>

<p>The girl looked slowly round. “I do not know
where she is, my mistress,” she said. “Three days
ago there came an English gentleman——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“English?” he interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>“But yes. Madame said he was English. He saw
her—he went away. Yesterday Madam left; she will
come no more. She is gone, perhaps, to England. I
do not know, I swear.”</p>

<p>André reflected. Yes, it was more than possible that
“the princess” had returned to England.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he demanded next, “why she
left?”</p>

<p>“Because,” her voice dropped, “she feared the
vengeance of the Marquise de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>André vividly recollected the scene when he had
come to consult the crystal-gazer. The girl was not
lying.</p>

<p>“And you know nothing more?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>She took the gold piece greedily. André had his
foot in the stirrup when a thought struck him.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he asked persuasively, “why you
thought I was of the police?”</p>

<p>The girl beckoned him within and closed the door.</p>

<p>“Monsieur the superintendent of police has twice
been here this week to inquire about my mistress,”
she answered softly. “This very morning he was
here. He would know everything would monsieur the
superintendent. But he does not pay and he learned
nothing, nothing, I swear.” She laughed knowingly.</p>

<p>André mounted and rode away. Fate was against
him. Well, it could not be helped now. And the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
news of that English gentleman and the inquiries
of the police were disquieting. What were English
gentlemen doing at “The Cock with the Spurs of
Gold” when England was at war with France? No
wonder the police, the Marquise’s friend in particular,
were prowling about so suspicious an inn. No wonder
the crystal-gazer had taken to flight.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” cried a boyish voice. A galloping
horse had suddenly pulled up beside André’s. “You,
Vicomte, you! The very man that is wanted.”</p>

<p>André had at the sudden challenge whipped out his
sword to defend himself. He now peered through the
gloom.</p>

<p>“Chevalier, you!” he exclaimed in intense suspicion
and annoyance.</p>

<p>“Yes, I, Chevalier de St. Amant. I am in luck.
There’s the devil’s own business here.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” André demanded angrily. To be
detected in this wood by the Chevalier, of all men, was
maddening.</p>

<p>“Treachery,” said the Chevalier briefly.</p>

<p>“Treachery?”</p>

<p>St. Amant was excited. “I was on my way to Paris
by the King’s orders to overtake a courier. I took
the short cut through this wood; you know it doubtless.
I hear a groan, I dismount, and there is the
courier in the ditch, tied hand and foot, gagged too,
poor devil, and his despatches gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone?” A shiver ran down André’s back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Clean as a whistle. The idiot had taken the short
cut, too. As far as I can make out he was attacked
from behind, stunned, and robbed. Will you help to
bring the poor wretch back to Versailles, for I must go
on to Paris?”</p>

<p>André sat appalled. “Of course,” he replied
presently.</p>

<p>“This is the Vincennes affair over again,” the
Chevalier remarked when they had unbound the
courier and set him on André’s horse. “It is devilish
this treachery, devilish and amazing.”</p>

<p>De Nérac nodded. He was in no mood to discuss
anything with anybody just now, least of all with the
Chevalier de St. Amant.</p>

<p>The young man had mounted. “I am very sorry,”
he said, “that I cannot offer to accompany you, but
the King’s orders were urgent and I am already late.
Good-night, Vicomte.”</p>

<p>André bowed stiffly.</p>

<p>“If I might suggest,” the Chevalier added in the
friendliest way, “it would be well to say nothing of
this damnable business until the King has been informed
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” André replied coldly. “I had
already intended to wait until His Majesty had heard
the story from your lips.”</p>

<p>“Good. I shall be back at dawn.” The Chevalier
spurred away.</p>

<p>As De Nérac rode slowly back the Marquise’s words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
rang in his ears—“This is the second time in three
months. There will be a third before long.” The
third had already come, and as usual like a thief in the
night. Confound “No. 101”! Confound the Chevalier
de St. Amant!</p>

<p>He was in no mood to go to bed. He would walk
in one of the galleries until he had eased himself of all
the black thoughts and fears, until he could see a path
through the thickets into which fate had plunged him.</p>

<p>A party of his friends was still playing at dice, and
as André passed through the room they stared at his
muddy riding boots in amused surprise.</p>

<p>“You have news?” cried the Comte de Mont Rouge.</p>

<p>“Yes,” André retorted curtly, “bad news which
you will learn later.”</p>

<p>“What the devil has he been doing?” he heard St.
Benôit exclaim as André sharply left the room.</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” Mont Rouge laughed. “He has
already begun to do the dirty work of that grisette.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” St. Benôit demanded.</p>

<p>“She is going to make him master of her household.”</p>

<p>“De Nérac? Master of the Pompadour’s household?
Impossible!” A dozen voices protested, and
the dice-boxes ceased to rattle.</p>

<p>“Wait and you will see,” Mont Rouge’s cynical
tones replied.</p>

<p>“Where and how did you learn this?” St. Benôit
asked, aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“The Comtesse des Forges told me,” Mont Rouge
answered. “She is in the confidence of St. Amant,
who as we all know is the King’s most confidential
secretary.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” André, who had caught his friend’s
denial, halted involuntarily behind the door, picturing
to himself Mont Rouge’s shrug of the shoulders.
Well, it was only one more item in a long account, an
account that would be settled some day.</p>

<p>“If it is true,” said the Abbé St. Victor, “that De
Nérac has sold himself, he will be ruined when she is
ruined. It is a pity, but he will deserve it.”</p>

<p>Ruined? André laughed the laugh of a reckless
gambler staking his last piece. Ruined? They would
see.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>TWO PAGES IN THE BOOK OF LIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> curtain over the alcove was very cautiously
lifted. Madame de Pompadour looked up from her
papers. “Good afternoon, Vicomte,” she smiled. “I
was expecting you; you observe I am alone.”</p>

<p>“Expecting me, Madame?” André demanded,
astonished.</p>

<p>“To be sure, expecting you to report your account
of this baffling affair in the woods with which all Versailles
rings and to return my key.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing but what everybody knows of the
matter, nor am I here to return your key, but to keep
it.” Madame studied him with calm satisfaction.
“Yes, Marquise, I am here because I have decided to
enter your service.”</p>

<p>The lady leaned back in her chair and laughed.
“But it is impossible, my dear Vicomte,” she replied
lightly. “His Majesty has already appointed a master
of my household.” She rose and looked into his face,
stern with a determination born of a prolonged inward
struggle. “You are disappointed. I thank you for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the compliment. No matter, we will arrange it
another way, you and I.”</p>

<p>“Will Madame kindly explain?”</p>

<p>“You have reflected on our chat yesterday?” she
asked. “Yes? You have counted the cost?” André
bowed in silence. “Good. I do not ask your reasons;
they are your affair, and the Vicomte does not act with
his eyes shut. But I am rejoiced, my friend; I could
sing with pleasure. To the <i>entente cordiale</i> and to our
success.” She held out her hand, and in the sunshine
of her gaze he raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>“Now listen. I have thought it all out. To the
world of Versailles we are for the future deadly enemies,
you and I. You have offended me. I have
insulted you. What could be more natural? Already
the idle tongues chatter in the galleries that the
Vicomte de Nérac has refused to accept the King’s
pleasure and that Madame is in tears of rage. That
is my inspiration, you understand. But you will still
keep my key and be in my service without any of the
disgrace—eh? <i>Mon Dieu</i> it will be droll.”</p>

<p>André smiled in admiration of her finesse. A
genius this marquise.</p>

<p>“But perhaps I shall not be in Versailles,” he said
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” she retorted gaily. “I have
already provided for that. It is my little secret—a
<i>vivandière’s</i> secret.”</p>

<p>She began slowly to roll up the plans on her table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>André’s eye caught one of the sheets. “Ah, you
recognise it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“To be sure. It is the Château de Beau Séjour.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and what the King can give the King can
take away,” she replied with her mysterious smile.
“Mademoiselle Denise—patience, my friend, and hear
me out—is very beautiful and very noble. It is better
for women who can afford it to be content with love,
their beauty, and their <i>noblesse</i>, and to leave politics
alone. Politics, intrigue are a very dangerous game,
particularly for young ladies. Mademoiselle would
find some very instructive lessons as to that in the history
of her château. It might well be that the King
might desire a second time to confer Beau Séjour on a
servant who had rendered precious service to his Sovereign.
And,” she added, throwing up her head, “I
hope Mademoiselle will learn that I will not be
thwarted in my plans by a girl even though she has
forty marshals of France in her pedigree.”</p>

<p>André listened in silence, but the colour in his
bronzed cheeks revealed the strong emotion within.</p>

<p>“And now to business.” Madame had almost unsexed
herself. The woman’s charm and grace melted
into a masculine, alert, and bracing keenness. She
beckoned to André to draw his chair up to the table.
“‘No. 101,’ that is our affair. After last night it is
more imperative than ever the mystery should be laid
bare. And it is clear that the treachery starts from
Versailles. You agree?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Yes, Madame.”</p>

<p>“Good. The clues unfortunately are very slight.
But not far from the palace is an inn called ‘The Cock
with the Spurs of Gold’—you know it?” she questioned
sharply.</p>

<p>“I was there eighteen months ago,” he replied,
recovering himself.</p>

<p>“No doubt on the same foolish errand as all of us.
But the crystal-gazer has vanished and cannot be
traced. It is no matter. We have to do with another
woman, a country wench called Yvonne of the Spotless
Ankles——”</p>

<p>“Yvonne?” He controlled himself with difficulty.</p>

<p>“A curious name for a peasant wench, is it not?
Well, I am convinced that this Yvonne in some way
yet to be fathomed is connected with this infernal
treachery. The police can discover nothing but to her
credit; the police, of course, are fools. Vicomte, it is
your task to master Yvonne’s secret.”</p>

<p>André’s fingers tapped on the table.</p>

<p>“You are a man, a soldier, a lover,” Madame continued
in her cool voice. “You understand women.
She is a peasant, you are a noble. A woman who
loves will tell everything. You take me?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.” He rose and began abruptly to pace
up and down as he always did when his thoughts over-mastered
him. Madame consulted her tablets.</p>

<p>“And then there is the Chevalier de St. Amant,”
she resumed, and André came to a dead halt. “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and I do not love one another. The King has his
secrets from his ministers, from his valet, from me,
secrets of policy, and of his private life. The Chevalier
is the King’s creature, his confidant, and he is ambitious.
He fears my influence, he is an adventurer, a
parvenu. When he has destroyed me the hand of
Mademoiselle Denise will wipe out his antecedents, will
by a stroke of the King’s pen make him ruler of
France and one of its greatest nobles. But,” she rose,
“he shall not, he shall not.”</p>

<p>“No,” said André in a low voice, “by God he shall
not!”</p>

<p>Madame smiled. “It is your task and mine,” she
added, “to defeat, to crush, the Chevalier de St.
Amant.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said André simply.</p>

<p>“We are engaged on a perilous task. There is a
plot, more than one, on foot to drive me from Versailles.
And they are all in it, the Queen and her ladies,
monseigneurs the archbishops and bishops, the Dauphin
and the princesses of the blood, the ministers,
the nobles, the army, even the King’s valet. In the
council, the galleries, the royal study, even the King’s
bedroom, day and night they are scheming and intriguing.
It will be a duel to the death—one woman
against the Queen, the Church, the ministers, and the
<i>noblesse</i>, but he who will decide is the King.”</p>

<p>She flung her arms up with a superbly dramatic
gesture. Standing there in the triumphant consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
of her beauty she would have moved the most
merciless of her critics to admiration. And the man
who would decide was Louis XV.</p>

<p>“He is strange, the King,” she mused as if she had
forgotten André, “how strange but few can guess—at
one moment the slave of his passion, at another burning
with a king’s ambition, at a third indolent and
dull, at a fourth consumed by remorse, tortured by fear
of God and the pains of hell. The ennui of a royal
life, that is his bane. The woman who can amuse him,
keep him from himself, he will never desert. And I
will be that woman. My beauty will fade, but give
me first five years—five years as I am to-day—and it
will be death alone that will separate the King and me.”</p>

<p>“And you will rule France, Marquise?”</p>

<p>She wheeled with a flash of fire. “Yes,” she said,
“I will rule France through the King.”</p>

<p>There was silence. Madame leaned against the
carved mantelpiece; her eyes passed over the salon
with its wealth and its refinement out into the measureless
spaces of the future, to the rosy peaks known
only to the dreams of ambition.</p>

<p>“Paris,” she murmured, “calls me happy, fortunate.
Listen,” and she recited:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Pompadour, vous embellissez</div>
<div class="indent">La cour, Parnasse et Cythère.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“M. de Voltaire is a poet. The homage of the poets,
the philosophers, the artists, the wits, the homage of
the world to her beauty, the love of a king—what can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
a woman desire more? I have them to-day, but shall
I keep them? <i>Mon Dieu!</i> do they reflect, these mere
men and women, what it costs to keep them? My
life is a martyrdom. A false step, a stupid word, to
be gay when I should be silent, to be dull when I
should be gay—these may hurl me from my place.
And the intrigues! The intrigues! Vicomte, I declare
to you that at night I lie awake reckoning with
tears what the day has accomplished, wrestling with
what to-morrow may bring. Heartless, frivolous, and
false are my foes. Is it surprising that I too should
be heartless, frivolous, false? But I would not change
my lot. No! Better far one year with the cup of
pleasure at one’s lips; better far one glorious year in
Versailles of passion and power, than an eternity of
that life I knew as Madame d’Étiolles. Yes; if in
twelve months I must pay the price at the Bastille I
would drink now to the full the joys of an uncrowned
queen of France.”</p>

<p>She sat down overpowered by the visions of her own
spirit.</p>

<p>And André listened with a unique thrill of awe,
torn by conflicting emotions. Of his own free will he
had asked for her help because his ambitions thrust
the sacrifice on him. Away from her presence he recalled
with a shiver a word, a gesture, a look, that
spoke of a cold selfishness, even of an insolent vulgarity,
so strangely blended with such grace, charm,
and sympathy. Her low birth, her position at Versailles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
stirred in him the contempt that was the heritage
of eight centuries of noble ancestors. But once
face to face with her all his misgivings, all his scorn and
dislike, melted away. And he dimly felt that her victory
was no mere triumph of a beautiful and gifted
woman over a man’s passion, the appeal of the flesh to
the flesh, such as he knew and had yielded to so often.
This was no mere idol of a royal and fleeting devotion,
no mere splendid courtesan of Nature’s making; it was
the breath of the human spirit to the human spirit,
blowing with the divine mystery of the wind where it
listed on the answering spaces of the sea. And the
soaring sweep of her ambition awoke in his soul ambitions
not less daring and supreme. What man in
whom the ceaseless call of the siren voices within,
voices that no priestly code, no laws, and no arguments
can still, voices whose sweetness and strength
rise from the unfathomable abysses where flesh and
spirit are indistinguishable—what man who has from
childhood listened to those voices within but must feel
the triumphant echo when he finds a woman tempted
and inspired as he has been tempted and inspired?
Madame de Pompadour might be what the Court said,
but there were hopes, visions, in her which the Court
and King would never fathom, which it might be well
she herself could only see and follow because she must.
She was fate, this woman, the fate of France. Let
others judge her. He could not. It was enough to
listen to her summons and to obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>And so they sat in silence lapped each in the glamour
of their dreams. Sharp awaking came with the
abrupt entrance of Madame’s mistress of the robes.</p>

<p>“The King,” she cried, “the King is coming,” and
she promptly fled.</p>

<p>The Marquise rose almost in terror. “Quick,
quick,” she whispered, “you have the key.”</p>

<p>But Louis had already entered, sullen and bored.</p>

<p>André’s genius did not desert him. “Madame,”
he exclaimed with a matchless mixture of dismay and
despair, “I am ruined. The King has discovered me.”</p>

<p>Louis broke into a laugh. His royal and jaded
humour was tickled by the comic dejection in the
Vicomte’s face as he shamefacedly kneeled to kiss the
King’s hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi!</i> The gentleman should think of the lady,”
he said smiling, “and not merely of himself.”</p>

<p>“True, Sire, when the lady will think presently of
the gentleman. But in this case the lady will not
think of him at all—alas!”</p>

<p>André’s half-droll, half-passionate sigh provoked a
second royal laugh.</p>

<p>“I must find employment for this idle vicomte,”
Louis remarked to Madame, “and not in your household,
<i>parbleu!</i>”</p>

<p>“I fear not, more’s the pity,” André answered.</p>

<p>The King flung himself into a chair. His ennui
had remastered him, and he stared at the screen dully.
“Your Majesty is tired,” the Marquise murmured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
kneeling to slip a cushion under his head. “I will
read to you something amusing.”</p>

<p>“Not for worlds. They do not write amusing books
in Paris to-day as they once did.” He stared at the
carpet, then at her faultless dress, and André observed
how his hand listlessly rested on hers as she remained
kneeling by his side.</p>

<p>“It is only the book of life that is amusing, Sire,”
she retorted with a gay nod. “Your Majesty writes a
fresh page in mine every day.”</p>

<p>“Is it amusing?” he asked with a faint flash of
interest.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you, Sire, what my woman said this
morning? ‘Do you laugh, Madame,’ quoth she,
‘when the King talks because it is a jest or because he
is the King?’”</p>

<p>Louis looked up. “And your answer?”</p>

<p>“You must guess, Sire.”</p>

<p>“Because he is the King,” he said gloomily.</p>

<p>“No, no. ‘The King never jests with me,’ I replied,
‘and he is never the King to me; he is only—’”
she completed the sentence by a curtsey to her heels
and the suspicion of a kiss on his fingers.</p>

<p>“You are a foolish woman,” was the royal reply.
The impenetrable eyes cleared for a moment.</p>

<p>André was thrilled by the ripple of laughter that
floated through the room. “Ah, Sire, now you jest
for the first time—absolutely the first time.”</p>

<p>She rose. “Monsieur le Vicomte,” she said quickly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
“you have His Majesty’s permission to retire.” Then
as he took his leave, “You are a man, my friend,” she
whispered softly, “and you saved us both. I shall
not forget,” and behind her Sovereign’s back she blew
him an intoxicating adieu.</p>

<p>As the door closed Madame de Pompadour was
whispering in Louis’s ear and a hearty royal laugh
rang out.</p>

<p>For in such ways do kings permit themselves to be
governed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>ANDRÉ IS THRICE SURPRISED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great historical buildings in Paris bear witness
with eloquence and beauty to the genius and ambition
of the many royal rulers who during three centuries of
a wonderfully dramatic history have led a nation itself
gifted with genius and ambition. Versailles alone is
the exception, for in Versailles even the most ignorant
and cold-blooded of modern sightseers feels at every
step that the years have vanished, that he breathes the
air of the grand age, that he is face to face with the
monument of one historic figure and one alone—Louis
XIV. Gone is the bitter memory of 1870; gone is the
tragedy of Marie Antoinette. Alike in the stately
splendour of the Galerie des Glaces, in the cold loneliness
of the chapel, in the ordered magnificence of these
haughty gardens, most of all in the imperial pomp of
the royal bedroom, dominates the spirit of the Roi
Soleil—the King who made kingship the art and the
science and the creed of a nation’s life.</p>

<p>As one steps to-day into the empty stillness of that
memorable Œil de Bœuf the light from the oval windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
seems to fall only on those white and gold doors
beyond which lies the state bed-chamber. But wait
in patience and the loneliness will vanish; the room is
now crowded with the courtiers awaiting the grand
lever of majesty; a hundred tongues are discussing
eagerly the events of the hour, a hundred eyes watch
with feverish eagerness all who have the right to pass
and repass those jealously-guarded portals, behind
which monarchy, on whose caprice turns the fate of
ministers and nobles, is dressing.</p>

<p>“The King,” said Mont Rouge to St. Benôit, “is as
playful this morning as he was last night. Ah, you
have not heard?” he added. “Well, when the Duke
de Richelieu was pulling off His Majesty’s boots, ‘How
many times, by the bye, Duke, have you been in the
Bastille?’ asked the King. ‘Three times, Sire,’
Richelieu replied stiffly. ‘Odd numbers are unlucky,’
said the King in his slow way, and even Richelieu
was annoyed.”</p>

<p>“A pretty plain hint,” St. Benôit remarked.
“What has Richelieu been doing? Another love affair
and a duel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he was only saucy to the Pompadour at
supper. That woman is itching to show that dukes
can be treated like kitchen wenches.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But she doesn’t get her way with every one.
De Nérac has positively refused to enter her
service, and the King is more pleased with him than
ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“It is true, then, that he has been given the Cordon
Bleu?” Mont Rouge demanded with a flash of
jealousy.</p>

<p>“Quite true, the lucky dog,” answered the Duke of
Pontchartrain, who had joined them, “and the extraordinary
thing is that the Pompadour, who was very
angry with De Nérac, jested about it last night.”</p>

<p>“But what has De Nérac done to get the Cordon
Bleu?” Mont Rouge growled.</p>

<p>The Duke shrugged his shoulders. “Have you forgotten
the night before Fontenoy, my friend?” His
voice dropped. “This mysterious affair of yesterday
in the woods, too,” he whispered, “is all part of the
same infernal business.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“I do. The King and the ministers are convinced
that the Vincennes business, this affair of the woods,
and that Fontenoy treachery all come from the same
hand—a hand near at home.”</p>

<p>Mont Rouge and St. Benôit drew the Duke into a
corner.</p>

<p>“The traitor then is here? In Versailles?” St.
Benôit asked.</p>

<p>“It is the only explanation.”</p>

<p>Mont Rouge passed a perplexed hand over his chin.
“Good Lord!” he ejaculated. “Think you that
woman has—”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied the Duke with sharp conviction.
“The Pompadour is as anxious to discover the traitor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
as the King or d’Argenson himself. You may take
your oath of that. Heavens! man, if she can lay bare
this inscrutable mystery she will earn the King’s gratitude
for the rest of her naughty life.”</p>

<p>“And what has De Nérac to do with——?”</p>

<p>“What De Nérac discovered last night,” St. Benôit
interrupted, “is known only to the King and himself.
You will get nothing from him; he is pledged to
secrecy. But”—he paused to beckon to the Abbé de
St. Victor to join them—“but it makes it more necessary
than ever for us to have De Nérac on our side.”</p>

<p>“I do not see that,” Mont Rouge objected.</p>

<p>St. Benôit’s foot tapped impatiently. “If our
scheme,” he urged, “to persuade the King to expel
the Pompadour is to succeed, De Nérac must be our
ally. It is as clear as daylight.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the Duke, “of course. Drive De
Nérac into the Pompadour’s arms and together they
will discover the traitor, and the Comte de Mont Rouge
will presently be compelled to prefer the village
wenches on his estates in Poitou to the ladies of
Versailles.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the Abbé assented. “We must have De
Nérac, for he knows more than any of us, and he has
courage. Courage is a rare thing in Versailles.”</p>

<p>“I agree,” Mont Rouge said slowly. “But if he
won’t join us in getting rid of that detestable woman
then he must share her fate.”</p>

<p>“There is André,” St. Benôit gladly remarked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
“Let us congratulate him on his refusal to stain his
honour by obedience to a wanton of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>.”</p>

<p>But they were anticipated by the Chevalier. “My
felicitations, Vicomte,” the young man was saying,
“for you are the first to teach our new and high-born
marquise her place.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” André replied sweetly, to the
disgust and astonishment of his friends.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” Mont Rouge growled as the Chevalier
smilingly left them to pass into the King’s bedroom,
for as a royal favourite he had that privileged <i>entrée</i>,
“I would sooner pull that coxcomb’s ears than accept
his congratulations even if I were a Cordon Bleu.”</p>

<p>“My dear Mont Rouge,” André answered, “the
King will not permit us now to pull a coxcomb’s ears,
but some day I hope to have that pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure, some day?” Mont Rouge sneered.</p>

<p>“To be sure. When you have turned out our
mistress, Madame la Marquise de Pompadour, you
shall help me to pull the ears of the Chevalier de St.
Amant.”</p>

<p>André in fact was in a rare humour. His plans
were now arranged to a nicety. With the Pompadour’s
help “No. 101” was to be discovered and Denise won.
The mystery of last night had suggested half a dozen
clues. His star was once more in the ascendant. The
great game to be played required courage, resource,
and Machiavellian cunning. This was the beginning.
The rest would follow. Ah! the white and gold doors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
were thrown open; hats came off; the King had entered,
and all eagerly surveyed his bored, inscrutable
countenance.</p>

<p>“Is the Vicomte de Nérac here?” Louis demanded
presently, and André stepped forward to kiss his hand.
“Monsieur le Vicomte,” he proceeded in his slow,
soft, yet clear voice, “you will bear my humble salutations
to her Majesty the Queen and say that I offer her
Majesty, for the vacant place of the captain of her
guard, the services of the bravest officer in the Chevau-légers
of my Guards—yourself.”</p>

<p>A loud hum, partly of warm approval, partly of excited
and jealous comment, drowned André’s thanks.</p>

<p>“By G-Gad,” stammered Des Forges, “another s-slap
for the fishy g-grisette—eh?”</p>

<p>“She’s going, yes, she’s going; God be praised!”
muttered the Abbé St. Victor.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” St. Benôit cried, “more
than ever we must keep De Nérac on our side,” and
Mont Rouge sulkily assented.</p>

<p>The Duke de Pontchartrain thoughtfully stroked his
lace ruffles. “I am puzzled,” he remarked aside to St.
Benôit; “I wonder if it really means that the King
has thrown over the grisette, or whether—” he paused.</p>

<p>“Well?” St. Benôit demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>“De Nérac is deep, devilish deep,” the Duke mused,
“and so is the King. If De Nérac is not on our side it
will play old Harry with our plot to have him ruling
the roost in her Majesty’s apartments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>But his friends laughed his suspicions away. De
Nérac had insulted the Pompadour and he had been
rewarded with the captaincy of the Queen’s Guards.
What could be better?</p>

<p>Meanwhile André, having executed his commission
and been flattered by the joyful reception of the news
by the Queen’s ladies, was somewhat grimly reflecting
in the Hall of the Queen’s Guards on this new turn of
fortune’s wheel. Truly the Pompadour was a wonderful
woman. She had promised to arrange and she
had kept her word. To be placed in an office which
must daily bring him into touch with Denise was better
than he had ever dreamed. A genius the Pompadour
as he had said, and this was the woman whom the
priests and ministers and courtiers hoped to expel.
Poor blind fools! They little knew the whole truth.
Yes, his star was in the ascendant. The Machiavellian
game must be played out; it promised victory and
Denise.</p>

<p>The rustle of a dress roused him. It was Denise,
and surely that was the Chevalier de St. Amant parting
from her.</p>

<p>“You have heard the King’s will, Mademoiselle,”
André said quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. Very lovely she looked
at that moment, though her manner was strangely
cold.</p>

<p>“You do not congratulate me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>André glanced at her with sharp surprise.</p>

<p>“After your kind words on my return,” he began,
“I had hoped, Mademoiselle, more for your congratulations
than for those of any other in Versailles.”</p>

<p>Denise made no reply; she quietly moved away.</p>

<p>“Denise,” he broke out passionately. “Denise——”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle la Marquise, if you please, Monsieur
le Vicomte,” she interrupted with her head high in
air, and André could only gaze at her in mute
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she continued, “Mademoiselle la Marquise
for the future. And if you would know the reason ask
your conscience, the conscience of one who was once
a noble and soldier of France.” André would have
spoken, but she made a peremptory sign with her
hand. “It is the second time,” she resumed, “I have
been bitterly disappointed. Our world believes that
you have had the courage to refuse the temptation of
that woman, that the King’s reward was due to your
courage and your loyalty. Unhappily I know better.
You are Captain of the Queen’s Guards because it is
the wish of the Marquise de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle!”</p>

<p>“You deny it?” She paused. “That, Monsieur le
Vicomte, unfortunately does not make it less true. But
do not be alarmed. I shall not betray your secret.
And if you will, let my silence be due to the friendship
of the past, a friendship that you yourself by your own
act have severed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>She turned her back on him. But André had swiftly
opened the door for her.</p>

<p>“It would be impertinent for me to ask for a hearing,”
he said slowly. “That you will not betray my
secret as you are pleased to call it is very kind. In
return, Mademoiselle, I promise that I will not betray
yours.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met. André faced her unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“My secret?” Denise demanded, but she could not
quite control her voice.</p>

<p>“Your secret, Marquise.” He bowed low.</p>

<p>He had the bitter satisfaction, if satisfaction it was,
to see a faint thrill of fear—or was it trouble?—pass
into her eyes. And now that he was alone he strode
about the room letting his anger master him, once
more a prey to all the black doubts and fears. There
was only one explanation—that the Chevalier had
wormed out the truth, and for his own purposes had
hastened to share his knowledge with Denise. The
Court was hoodwinked, but they were not. Cruelest
of all, he could not deny it, and the disdain in the face
and figure of the woman he loved had cut more sharply
than her words. He clenched his fist. He could not
go back now—no, he had chosen his path; but the
day would come, he swore, when he should prove that
it was his love and the ambition that it inspired which
had driven him to defy the Court, his class, and
herself.</p>

<p>There was work to be done which could not wait.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
He galloped away into the woods. “Yvonne,” he
called out, dismounting at the stables of “The Cock
with the Spurs of Gold.”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur,” she exclaimed, flinging back her
matted yellow hair and springing up. He had surprised
her with skirt pinned up to the knees milking
her sleek cow. She was indeed Yvonne of the Spotted
Cow, Yvonne of the Spotless Ankles. Bah! it was a
pity her face was so smudged, her bodice so ragged
and dirty, for her figure was excellently straight and
supple. “Monseigneur!” she humbly kissed his hand.</p>

<p>André felt strange qualms as he surveyed her in
silence. Something inexplicable in this peasant
wench seemed to make the task he had undertaken
disagreeable, almost revolting, yet she was only a farm
slut and he was a noble. And the secret perhaps of
“No. 101” was the prize.</p>

<p>“I want your help, Yvonne,” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>“My help?” she repeated as if she did not understand,
but there was a momentary gleam in her eyes.
“My help? He is not happy, Monseigneur? Ah,”
she gave a little cry, “the lady that he loves, the
Marquise, is faithless.”</p>

<p>“No,” he interrupted fiercely. “No, no! It is——”</p>

<p>She put her finger on her lip. “Some one is coming,”
she whispered. “Monseigneur has enemies,
many enemies. He must not be seen here. Come,
quick, quick!”</p>

<p>She half pushed him into the stables, closed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
locked the door and left him. André from within could
hear steps coming to and fro on the stones, could hear
voices. They ceased. The door opened.</p>

<p>“Who was it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Monsieur the Chevalier de St. Amant,” she replied
quietly.</p>

<p>“Name of a dog!” he ejaculated. He drew the girl
into the stables, put his hands on her shoulders. Such
firm, well-shaped shoulders under her dirty, ill-laced
bodice. “Now tell me,” he said peremptorily, “what
you know of the Chevalier de St. Amant.”</p>

<p>Yvonne faced him with a humble simplicity. Involuntarily
André dropped his hands, mastered by that
indefinable feeling. “Monsieur the Chevalier comes
here from time to time,” she answered; “he inquires
for the wise woman who lived here, but he also would
know if Monseigneur visits the inn and why?”</p>

<p>“Ah! And your answer?”</p>

<p>“That I know nothing.”</p>

<p>André scrutinised her remorselessly. Either she
told the truth or she was a consummate actress.</p>

<p>“Did I do right, Monseigneur,” she asked in her
simple way, “to say what was not true?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied quickly, but not without a stab
of shame. “And my enemies, Yvonne, what of my
enemies?”</p>

<p>“They are great gentlemen of the Court. They and
their servants come here, too, they watch Monseigneur.
They seek a traitor, so they say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>André reflected. It was what he feared. “I also
seek a traitor, Yvonne,” he began quietly, “and I am
in great trouble. I need your help.”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur is pleased to jest. My help—the help
of a peasant girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your help, Yvonne. The King, my master,
is betrayed. The traitor is unknown, but at this inn
perhaps one may learn what will reveal the truth.
You are here, you have eyes and ears. Will you
promise to tell me all that you can learn?”</p>

<p>The girl was looking at him, but her smudged face
disclosed nothing save a natural fear.</p>

<p>“Some might promise you,” he pursued, “money,
wealth, love. Money I have not got; love is not mine
to give——”</p>

<p>“It is an honour for a peasant girl,” she interrupted
softly, “to be loved by a noble who can give her jewels
and fine clothes and pleasure. And then when his
love is cold, as needs must be, he can make her happy
with a good dowry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is so. But,” he took her hand, “I
will not——”</p>

<p>“I am not pretty, alas!” she interrupted again, but
the coquetry in her figure was strangely provocative.</p>

<p>“Peace, child, peace! and listen. I cannot and will
not treat you as others might. Love is not mine to
give. But I ask your help, although I promise you
nothing in return save the grateful thanks of a soldier
of France.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“I would be your servant,” she whispered, “your
servant, Monseigneur.”</p>

<p>André felt her hand tremble. For the moment swift
passion tempted him, and Yvonne was watching him
closely though he did not know it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said brusquely, “you shall be my servant,
but nothing more.” She was silent, and he
feared he had made a fatal mistake. “Your help, that
is all I ask, and I ask it because I trust you.”</p>

<p>“I will help,” she said in a low voice. “I will
help.”</p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips as if it were the hand
of a gentlewoman. Why he did so strange a thing he
could not have explained.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried. “I am not worthy. Ah!
Monseigneur is not as other nobles. He has pity and
respect even for a peasant wench. He shall not dishonour
himself, and I—I will help because I am grateful,
yes, grateful.” For a moment she hid her face
overcome.</p>

<p>“Adieu, Yvonne,” he murmured, almost tenderly.
“Adieu, and remember!” He mounted and rode
away. As he turned into the woods a man rapidly
crossed the bridle track and disappeared, but not before
he had caught a sight of his face. Somewhere in the
past he had seen that face—when? Where? He knew
he was not mistaken, though in vain he racked his
brains. And with this fresh torturing thought he rode
into Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Yvonne had stood like one in a dream long after he
had disappeared. Now she surveyed with ill-concealed
disgust her pinned-up skirt and clumsy sabots, now
impatiently brushed a tear from under the matted hair
over her eyes. “<i>Dieu le Vengeur!</i>” She suddenly
threw up her arms with a gesture of pain, “<i>Dieu le
Vengeur!</i>” Then furtively glancing round she walked
slowly towards the house. On the threshold some one
met her and for a half-hour she might have been heard
conversing earnestly, almost pleading. The voices
ceased. A moment later the Chevalier de St. Amant
stepped out from the inn, jauntily flung his gay cloak
about him, and galloped swiftly in the direction of
Versailles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE FOUNTAIN OF NEPTUNE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> autumn evening had already closed in on the
noble gardens of Versailles. Alleys, parterres, and
walks alike were deserted save by the Fountain of
Neptune, where on a seat under the sombre shadows
of the stately trees a woman, cloaked to her feet and
hooded, sat patiently watching the ghostly glimmer of
the statues in the dusk. She had not to wait long
before a man cloaked also had quietly joined her.</p>

<p>“I am late, Mademoiselle,” he said, “but it is not
my fault.”</p>

<p>“It does not matter, Chevalier,” Denise replied
calmly, “the later the better for both of us.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. Ah, it is noble of you to come here
alone, you who have so much to lose if——”</p>

<p>“We will not talk of that, please. I am here of
my own free will and I would risk much more for the
sake of the Queen, my mistress, and for France.”</p>

<p>“Yet I would it were not necessary.”</p>

<p>“Unhappily it is. That woman’s spies have made
it impossible that you can any longer come to confer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
with the Queen’s friends by the secret passage; if we
are to succeed in our plan it must not be known that
you, who are in the King’s private service, are an ally
of the Ministers and of the Queen’s party; nor can you
now openly visit her Majesty’s apartments as you
did——”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Chevalier, “the new Captain of the
Queen’s Guards has prevented that.”</p>

<p>For a minute or two Denise was silent. “Secrecy is
necessary to success,” she resumed in a restrained
voice; “I am here as you know on behalf of the
Queen’s advisers; what others may think cannot affect
those who are my friends, who believe in me because
they believe in my—our—cause.”</p>

<p>“Not merely your friends, Marquise, but those who
love you.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, up there,” she pointed to the majestic
front of the palace, where the lights were beginning to
twinkle, “you can speak like that if you think fit.
Down here I beg you to remember I am an orphan, a
girl alone.”</p>

<p>And then both were silent.</p>

<p>“Are you sure, really quite sure,” Denise began,
“that the Vicomte de Nérac owes his appointment to
the intrigues of that woman?”</p>

<p>“I am absolutely sure.”</p>

<p>Denise sighed very faintly. “You will remember
your promise not to reveal this discovery to any one
else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Certainly. But is it necessary?”</p>

<p>“No, not necessary. I ask it as a favour.”</p>

<p>The Chevalier bowed. Again there was silence, for
her tone did not invite further question. “Have you
discovered anything fresh of importance?” Denise
asked presently.</p>

<p>“Several things, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Do they concern the Vicomte de Nérac?” she
demanded quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I do not wish to hear them. I cannot, I will
not,” she added in a low voice of emotion.</p>

<p>The Chevalier made a gesture of despairing dismay.
“But speak I must,” he said, “for things cannot be
worse than they are. The King is absolutely infatuated.
The Pompadour is wise enough to see that that
may not last; she will not rest therefore till she has
his Majesty completely in her power. This mysterious
treachery is her chance. Let her discover the truth
and the traitor and no one will prevail against her.”
He paused to add, “And the man who will discover it
for her is her friend and servant in secret, the Vicomte
de Nérac.”</p>

<p>“You believe that?” she faced him eagerly.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, if there is any man in Versailles
who can do it the Vicomte is that man.”</p>

<p>Denise clasped her hands. “What can we do,
Chevalier?” she asked. “What can we do?”</p>

<p>The Chevalier took a step or two up and down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
“There are only two courses,” he said very gravely.
“Either the Vicomte must be compelled to break with
the Pompadour—or—” he paused—“the King must be
persuaded to dismiss him from Versailles—in plain
words ruin him.”</p>

<p>Denise drew a deep breath. “Ah, God!” she murmured,
“that woman, how I hate her! She steals
the honourable soldiers of France and corrupts them;
she corrupts the King, she wrongs a Queen who has
wronged no one. Yes, I hate her because I am a
woman, to whom because I believe in God and my
<i>noblesse</i> these things are hateful.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Mademoiselle,” sincerity rang in
the boyish voice, “to me, too, she is the symbol in a
woman’s form of all that is evil in France, and it is
your France that will suffer for her ambition and her
sins.”</p>

<p>“She will be punished,” said Denise, “God will
punish her. <i>Dieu le Vengeur!</i>” she murmured.</p>

<p>The Chevalier had drawn a deep breath. “<i>Dieu le
Vengeur!</i>” he repeated to himself almost mockingly.
“It is a fine motto, <i>Dieu le Vengeur!</i>”</p>

<p>“It is strange,” she mused, “that you, Chevalier,
who were not born a French noble, should feel as we
do.”</p>

<p>“You have taught me,” he answered quietly.
“Yes, yes, when I entered the King’s service I found
a strange court and a strange master. It was you who
taught me, what I could scarcely believe, that there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
still in France women worthy to be called noble, aye,
and men, too. It is for your sake that I work, that I
would help to overthrow and punish that low-born
adventuress who would ruin the King. No, Marquise,”
he added, “I do not forget your warning, and
I say no more than this, that your love alone keeps me
true to my task, to your—our—cause.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” she answered with simple dignity.
“Let us work for France, Chevalier, and for the right,
and we shall win.”</p>

<p>He bid her adieu and vanished, for safety required
that he should leave her first. Denise sank back into
her seat lost in the bitter thought that André, the
friend of her girlhood, the lover of whom for all her indignation
she was proud, must either ruin her cause
or be ruined by herself and her friends. A step on
the gravel startled her.</p>

<p>“What is it, Chevalier?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p>The man peered into her face apparently as startled
as she was. “It is not the Chevalier unfortunately,”
André said with icy slowness, “but I am obliged for
the information, Marquise.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” It was an exquisitely cruel moment.
Flight on her part was impossible. “Ah, you came to
spy,” she burst out, beside herself.</p>

<p>“Why deny it?” was the cool answer. “You would
not believe me. So it was the Chevalier de St. Amant
who avoided me so successfully in the dark just now.
Happy Chevalier.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“I will, I can explain,” she began incoherently.</p>

<p>“Pardon,” he interrupted. “The conduct of Mademoiselle
la Marquise de Beau Séjour is no affair of
mine. I regret, however, that as I have intruded on
you I cannot offer you my escort, for it is neither in my
interest nor in yours, Mademoiselle, that you and I
should run the risk of being seen here by the Chevalier
de St. Amant or by any one else who talks of secrets
to all his friends. With your permission, therefore, I
will leave you.”</p>

<p>Denise dropped into her seat with a sob. That
André of all men should discover her here was anguish.
Nor was it only that his discovery might mean the
frustration of the schemes that were being so carefully
planned; it was the cruel humiliation of herself against
which all the womanhood in her cried out. If he had
reproached her, accused her, denounced her, insulted
her! No; he had only been cold as one who was indifferent
or was ready to believe any evil.</p>

<p>Yet André was as unhappy as she, could she have
but known it. Purely by accident on his return from
Paris had he stumbled on Denise in the dark, and torturing
thoughts made him feel bitter and then reckless.
Denise, his Denise! Surely there was nothing to live
for now. Love was a mockery and a sham. Women
were all alike, faithless, vain, frivolous, worthless.
He would do the Pompadour’s work without a twinge
of conscience now, he would take what life had to offer
of pleasure and revenge. Yes; he would revenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
himself to the full on this perjured, intriguing, and
immoral Court, and then he would go to die in the
Low Countries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Denise had returned safely to the Queen’s
apartments and after supper sat alone in her misery in
the room which opened off the hall of the Queen’s
Guards. The curtains were drawn, but the door was
ajar and she could hear a group of young nobles chattering
as they played cards. Scattered remarks broke
in on her bitter self-reproaches. Women’s names,
some of them her friends, some of them dancers at the
opera, were being freely bandied about. It was intolerable,
vile, and her cheek burned to think that it
was with these men that the priests and the ministers
and herself were working to overthrow the Pompadour.
She rose to close the door and shut out the scandalous
babble, when a remark stammered out by the Comte
des Forges sent a shiver through her.</p>

<p>“I t-tell you it is quite t-true,” he was saying.
“Mont Rouge has l-learned that she m-met the Chevalier
by the F-fountain of Neptune this very evening.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” Mont Rouge assented in his most
cynical tone. “But don’t spill the wine on the dice,
dear friend.”</p>

<p>“But how did you learn?” several voices demanded.</p>

<p>“As one always does, from another woman, of
course.” Mont Rouge was carelessly rattling the
dice-box.</p>

<p>“And you believe it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Certainly. Your turn to throw, Des Forges. Gad!
your hand is shaky to-night. Why should I not believe
it? The Marquise, I suppose, is like the rest of
her sex, and,” he laughed softly, “the Chevalier is—the
Chevalier.”</p>

<p>Des Forges sniggered fatuously. “Sixes—s-sixes.
Name of St. Denys! You speak like a m-married
m-man, Mont Ro-ouge.”</p>

<p>“What is Mont Rouge’s last scandal?” André had
entered.</p>

<p>Half a dozen tongues eager with malice repeated the
story. There was a pause. Denise stood thrilled. Her
fate was in his hands.</p>

<p>“This is not scandal,” André said slowly and very
clearly. “It is a lie.”</p>

<p>Chairs were excitedly pushed back. Dice-boxes and
a table rolled over. Then dead silence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the clear voice. “I repeat it is a
lie.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte,” Mont Rouge was speaking
with an affectation of marked politeness but his voice
shook with passion, “I beg you to remember who is
responsible for the story. You will withdraw that
insult.”</p>

<p>“At half-past six,” André proceeded calmly, “I was
at the Fountain of Neptune. The Chevalier de St.
Amant was not there. The Marquise de Beau Séjour
was not there. The Comte de Mont Rouge will therefore
no doubt see fit to withdraw his insult.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Where is the Chevalier de St. Amant?” “Have the
Chevalier fetched,” suggested two or three.</p>

<p>“No,” said André firmly. “This is not the Chevalier’s
affair. The Comte de Mont Rouge can deal
with him when and how he pleases. For my part I
repeat that the statement about the Marquise de Beau
Séjour, for which apparently Monsieur le Comte is
responsible, is a lie, and I have proved it.”</p>

<p>“The Vicomte de Nérac talks,” Mout Rouge answered
fiercely, “as if <i>his</i> honour had been questioned.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it has until you have withdrawn what you
said.”</p>

<p>“And supposing I refuse to withdraw at your dictation?”</p>

<p>“It would be only what I expect. Gentlemen, I
now assert in the presence of you all that the Comte de
Mont Rouge is a liar, and I shall continue to repeat it
until——”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” Mont Rouge interrupted. “You will not
repeat it. But at half-past six to-morrow morning you
will also in the presence of these gentlemen doubtless
permit me to teach you that I am not to be insulted
even by a Cordon Bleu!”</p>

<p>André bowed. “The Comte de St. Benôit will
make the necessary arrangements,” he said quietly,
“with the gentleman whom you will name.”</p>

<p>The room slowly emptied. André paced to and fro.
The curtain was sharply flung aside, and he saw Denise
pale and trembling.</p>

<p class="caption">The curtain was sharply flung aside, and he saw Denise.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“You will not fight?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“I have no choice, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why did you say it?” she questioned passionately.</p>

<p>“It is surely very simple. Mademoiselle la Marquise
has no father, husband, nor brother to maintain her
honour. To me as Captain of the Queen’s Guards
belongs by right the duty of defending her Majesty’s
ladies from insults and lies.”</p>

<p>“But it was true,” she whispered brokenly.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered. “What was said and implied
was not true. It was a lie, and you, Mademoiselle,
please God, know it as I hope to do.”</p>

<p>The colour leaped into Denise’s cheeks. The thanks
in her eyes were intoxicating.</p>

<p>“But if you are killed?” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Why, then, I suppose the Marquise de Pompadour
will have the pleasure of appointing my successor.”</p>

<p>Denise shrank at the remorseless taunt. André’s
face was pitiless.</p>

<p>“Do not be distressed,” he added as if he were addressing
the wall. “I have a long account with the
Comte de Mont Rouge and I welcome the opportunity
of settling it so satisfactorily. Besides it is high time
that these shameless tongues should be silenced. I
do assure you that after to-morrow the Marquise de
Beau Séjour will have nothing to fear—but the truth.”</p>

<p>Denise turned appealingly to him. “André!” she
whispered softly. “André!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>For a moment his hands clenched. “Monsieur le
Vicomte,” he corrected, frigidly, “who is your servant,
Marquise.”</p>

<p>He raised the curtain with a stately reverence. In
silence she walked past him, her head bowed, and in
silence he saluted as became the Captain of the Queen’s
Guard, to a maid of honour and a marquise. The
gleam of the candles in their gilt sconces fell on her
hair and neck, on the jewels on her breast. Then the
curtain slowly swung between them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the woman of the Marquise de Beau Séjour
brought in the morning cup of chocolate she found her
mistress had passed a sleepless night of tears; but she
was able to tell her that the Vicomte de Nérac had for
the fiftieth time vindicated his superb swordsmanship,
and that the Comte de Mont Rouge would not use his
right arm for many weeks to come. And Denise knew
that the Court had heard the last of that meeting by
the Fountain of Neptune.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>DENISE’S ANSWER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Queen’s ladies had been entertaining their
friends, and the antechamber was well filled with a
company of the most fashionable and powerful of the
<i>noblesse</i>, particularly of those high-born ladies and
gentlemen who devoted whatever time they could spare
from breaking the Ten Commandments with a dulcet
courtesy to the amusement of political intrigue.
Strangely enough the Queen’s friends were drawn from
three very different types—there were the “devout,”
<i>les dévots, les rigoristes</i>, to whom the free-thinking of
the fashionable philosophers coming to be the mode in
the Faubourg St. Germain was <i>anathema maranatha</i>,
my lords of the hierarchy of the bishops, with the high-born
women who were their obedient pupils; there
were the “fribbles,” the great seigneurs with their
wives and sisters and daughters privileged morally as
well as politically if only the breach were made within
their own class and with due regard to etiquette and
good manners, the men and women born within the
purple who sincerely believed that “God could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
condemn a person of that quality” for what would be
mortal sin in a <i>bourgeois</i>; and there were the “snobs,”
the women above all of the inferior <i>noblesse</i> remorselessly
struggling upwards who snatched at the splendid
opportunity a queen’s cause and a minister’s cause
offered. Monsieur the Dauphin, mesdames the princesses
of the blood were known to hate Madame
de Pompadour, to be plotting her overthrow; that
was enough. Surely with royalty lay the social
future.</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure,” the Abbé St. Victor was explaining
with the smile of the lay <i>roué</i> to the Duchesse de
Pontchartrain, “the King’s sin would be only one-half
as heinous if Madame de Pompadour were simply a
widow or even a demoiselle”; he took a pinch of snuff
and regretfully shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Or if she were really vulgar,” the Duchess interposed
with the pouting staccato which she knew became
her best. “I wonder if all <i>bourgeoise</i> women
are like her. She is not vulgar, alas! and really it is
her duty to be vulgar. Pontchartrain says she dresses
better than I do.”</p>

<p>“That is mere outward show,” the Abbé remarked,
“as well as being not true.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” the Duchess asked with an air of profundity,
“if a woman can be vulgar inside without
being vulgar outside.”</p>

<p>“She is not a Christian,” Mademoiselle Eugénie
pronounced. “That is enough for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“But she goes regularly to mass,” objected the
puzzled Duchess.</p>

<p>“To show her fine dresses to the Duke de Pontchartrain,”
Mademoiselle retorted with sour severity.
“Clothes, Madame, have nothing to do with religion.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake,” cried the Duchess, alarmed,
“don’t say so to Pontchartrain. It would put the
most embarrassing ideas into his head.”</p>

<p>The Abbé tittered into his lace handkerchief till he
was checked by the ferocious glare of the <i>dévotes</i> at
his elbow. “You will see how vulgar the Pompadour
can be,” he said hurriedly, “when you have turned
her out.”</p>

<p>“Inside out or outside in?” asked the Comtesse des
Forges to annoy Mademoiselle Eugénie.</p>

<p>“Oh, do let it be soon,” the Duchess pleaded,
“whichever way it is.”</p>

<p>The Abbé nodded mysteriously. He was as pleased
as the rest of the company that afternoon with the
progress of the great plot.</p>

<p>“You saw His Majesty’s confessor?” The Duke de
Pontchartrain had drawn Denise into a corner. “Is it
satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“Eminently so. His Majesty listened with great
attention, and was much impressed, his reverence
thought.”</p>

<p>“Good.” The Duke studied Denise’s eyes and
figure. What a magnificent <i>coryphée</i> she would have
made, to be sure, and how the diamonds he had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
given to that perfidious minx Babette would have
suited her. “The ministers,” he added quietly,
“have followed the confessor’s remonstrances up, I
hear. They urged how unpopular the lady was in
Paris. His Majesty likes popularity, you know, with
the <i>canaille</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Denise, “everything is going as we
could wish.”</p>

<p>Her eyes, like the Duke’s, had unconsciously crossed
the room, where André was talking to the Comtesse
des Forges.</p>

<p>“We miss Mont Rouge,” his Grace remarked carelessly.
“He was a valuable friend to the cause.”
Like the rest of the Court the Duke was ignorant of
what had brought about the duel, but the sudden
colour in Denise’s cheeks and her silence confirmed
his shrewd suspicions. “And,” he added with the
same carelessness, “I am not sure that De Nérac is—what
shall I say?—altogether a friend.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?” Denise asked almost
proudly.</p>

<p>The Duke shrugged his shoulders. “My fancy, I
suppose,” he answered lightly. “Perhaps, however,
our dear, captivating friend yonder will convert him.
She could convert St. Anthony if she really tried, eh?”</p>

<p>Denise knew that under this persiflage the Duke was
studying her closely and she was greatly relieved that
he now bowed himself away. For all his affectation
of being a man of pleasure and nothing more she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
divined his keen ability and wide knowledge of life.
He had talked to test her and she was angry that she
could not meet his searching gaiety with the polished
impenetrability that was his unique gift. She bitterly
resented, too, that André should stand there basking
in the languishing eyes of the Comtesse des Forges,
who was never happy save when she was making her
stammering nincompoop of a husband unhappy. Two
days had passed since that painful evening when he
had parted from her in the Salle des Gardes de la
Reine. He had proved his chivalry; he had triumphantly
vindicated her honour; why did he not give
her the opportunity to show that his conduct had appealed
both to her pride and her heart? Why had he
not come to ask and to receive forgiveness? Was it as
gossip whispered, that he really preferred the Comtesse
des Forges? Or was it, as the Duke had plainly hinted,
because he really preferred, what was far worse, the
service and rewards of Madame de Pompadour? And
reward him the mistress could, poor Denise was thinking;
for to the surprise of the Court the King had
simply ignored the duel, though in other similar cases
both victor and vanquished had been forbidden Versailles
for a season. And André was still Captain of
the Queen’s Guards. Denise’s foot beat on the floor.
Yes, in the King’s private salon André had a powerful
protector, herself and her friends a dangerous enemy,
yet her pride and gratitude alike forbade her to reveal
the truth to her allies—to the Queen, to the ministers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
to the <i>dévots</i>, to the nobles working together for a
common end.</p>

<p>André saluted her as he passed out. On the threshold
he paused to nod quietly to the Chevalier de St.
Amant, who was entering. The young man was as
gaily dressed as usual, but his boyish face was grave
and sad. He whispered something to the Duke de
Pontchartrain.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed his Grace, “impossible!”</p>

<p>“I wish it were,” said the Chevalier, “but it is quite
true.”</p>

<p>“Dismissed! The Comptroller-General dismissed!”
St. Benôit repeated, and the news flew round the room.
“But why? Why?”</p>

<p>“It is an intrigue,” the Chevalier explained.
“Messieurs Paris, the bankers, who are related to the
Pompadour, have refused to do any further business
with the Comptroller-General. And so His Majesty
has dismissed not the bankers but the minister.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” remarked the Comtesse des Forges,
“that the Pompadour has dismissed the Comptroller-General?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>The consternation was general. “It is no laughing
matter,” the Duke de Pontchartrain pronounced.
“This is the first time that that woman or any woman
in her position has interfered with high affairs of state.
It will not be the last.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Ah, I knew she must be vulgar inside,” cried his
Duchess triumphantly. “It is a pity she dresses so
well. The bankers pay, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“It is an outrage,” Mademoiselle Eugénie said.
“The Court must protest.”</p>

<p>“My dear lady,” answered the Duke with his most
finished scorn, “when a king owes twenty million
livres to a pair of money-lenders and wants twenty
million more you will find that it is they, not the
Court, who can protest.”</p>

<p>“And that is not all,” the Chevalier proceeded
grimly. “His Majesty has been pleased to promise
the reversion of the Comptroller-General’s place to the
Marquis de Vaudières.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! Impossible!” The consternation
increased, for the Marquis till a few weeks before
had been better known as Abel Poisson, Madame de
Pompadour’s brother.</p>

<p>“Charming,” said the Duke, “if His Majesty must
make marquises from the gutter at the bidding of a
grisette it is only fair he should enable them to be
masters of the public finances and to pay their way
by plunder. What is His Majesty’s next whim,
Chevalier?”</p>

<p>“What it will be to-morrow, Monseigneur, I cannot
say. The King has been pleased to do no more to-day
than what I have said.”</p>

<p>“And a very pretty day’s work it has been,” his
Grace replied. “Well, ladies, I have only one piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of advice to offer you. Smile, smile, smile, for if you
protest Madame la Marquise de Pompadour will turn
her attention to you. Do not forget that she has a
pretty <i>bourgeoise</i> daughter eight years old to whom
the post of maid of honour to her Majesty would be a
delightful and profitable education.”</p>

<p>He saluted the company, and taking most of the
men with him withdrew, for the situation was sufficiently
grave to demand an instant conference.</p>

<p>All the heart and gaiety had already been struck
out of the ladies. The Chevalier’s dejected air, so
strange to his careless and irrepressible spirit, was the
most telling comment on the menace in his news. To
the angry indignation and rapid questions of the ladies
he now replied with melancholy brevity. The King
was infatuated and obdurate, and Madame de Pompadour
was plainly determined to make him the instrument
of her vulgar vengeance.</p>

<p>“She has captured the King,” the young man remarked
in his gloomiest tones. “She will now coerce
the Queen. Her ambition is to be mistress of the robes
and thus to rule all Versailles.”</p>

<p>The mere suggestion of such an outrage on precedent
and etiquette made the ladies speechless with horror.
A <i>bourgeoise</i> mistress of the robes! It was unthinkable—blasphemous.
As if her Majesty in dressing
could take even the simplest garment except from the
hands of a princess of the blood or of a duchess.</p>

<p>“You forget, Madame,” the Chevalier remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
drily, “that the King’s will is law. <i>Le Roi gouverne
par lui-même.</i>”</p>

<p>They were the words of Louis XIV. To-day they
can still be read as the motto of Le Roi Soleil in the
centre of the superb ceiling of that Galerie des Glaces
at Versailles which enshrines for all generations the
imperial ambitions of the king who made it. Arrogant
words, but true.</p>

<p>The antechamber became gradually deserted. The
Chevalier stood at the window watching the gathering
gloom. His dejection was not acting. His boyish
face was almost tragic in its gravity. Presently he rose
and began to pace up and down, wrestling with his
thoughts, until he became suddenly aware that Denise
had re-entered and was looking at him in questioning
silence.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he advanced to meet her. “I have
no comfort for you. Before long I shall be bidding
you adieu for ever.”</p>

<p>Her eyes invited an explanation, but she said
nothing.</p>

<p>“I speak seriously,” he proceeded. “You and your
friends, Mademoiselle, are aware that I am with you
heart and soul in the desire to overthrow this woman
who will ruin us all. I have been able in the past, as
you know, to do some service to the cause by bringing
you information that I learned as His Majesty’s confidential
secretary. At your request I have to the best
of my power abstained from appearing publicly to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
of your party, for His Majesty is suspicious and jealous.
But I fear from to-day my services must end.”</p>

<p>“Why?” The single word revealed both anxiety
and sympathy.</p>

<p>“His Majesty has signified that for the present he
will conduct his private correspondence by himself. It
is the first step. The next will be that His Majesty no
longer needs my services in any capacity, that I am
free,” he laughed with gentle bitterness, “to leave
Versailles. Yes, Mademoiselle, I can no longer help
your cause.”</p>

<p>“That—that woman—” Denise began.</p>

<p>“Certainly. This is her doing. I stood between
her and such secrets as His Majesty was pleased to entrust
to me, secrets not known to ministers and to the
Court. So long as I was private secretary that woman
was not the King’s master. But when I am finally
dismissed she will rule the King body and soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cannot it be stopped?”</p>

<p>“No, Marquise. I am not as his grace of Pontchartrain
a great noble, not even a Comptroller-General.
I am the King’s creature, just as she is. His
Majesty made me, His Majesty can unmake me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“This is dreadful,” Denise murmured. “Without
your help, your information, your private influence
with the King, we shall be beaten, humiliated, ruined.
You have been a true friend to our cause, Chevalier.”</p>

<p>The young man bowed. “I have done my best,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
he said with unmistakable sincerity; “that Madame de
Pompadour should triumph cuts me to the heart. But
when I am obliged to leave Versailles her victory will
not be my only grief.”</p>

<p>Denise looked up at him. His tone had completely
altered.</p>

<p>“I shall leave you, Mademoiselle,” he said simply,
“and I love you. Ah! it is the truth, the bare truth.
You are a great noble, I am only the Chevalier de St.
Amant, a parvenu tolerated by the Court merely because
he is useful to them. It is presumption in me to
dare to love you. But even a parvenu’s heart can love.
This cause is sacred to me because not your beauty, nor
your nobility, nor your wealth, but the womanhood
that is the greatest gift of God to you has taught me
what you are—has taught me that your service can be
all that a man could desire.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur——” Denise began, but the words failed
her.</p>

<p>“I had hoped that some day I might, perhaps, have
dared to do more—to ask for your love in return. But
that is impossible—impossible.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” Denise asked in a low voice, almost as if she
were talking to herself.</p>

<p>“Yes, Marquise, because you love another.”</p>

<p>She looked up half angrily, half inquiringly.
“No,” she answered as he was still silent, “I do
not.”</p>

<p>St. Amant resumed his pacing up and down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
“Mademoiselle,” he said presently, “are you aware
how the King can be stopped in his present course?”</p>

<p>Denise turned eagerly towards him. “Madame de
Pompadour,” he added very slowly, “is only a woman,
but she has an ally, the Vicomte de Nérac, the ablest,
subtlest brain in all Versailles. He is ambitious; he
loves the Marquise de Beau Séjour—hear me out,
please. Take the Vicomte de Nérac from Madame
de Pompadour, make him her enemy, not her friend,
and——”</p>

<p>“You believe that?” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately it cannot be done,” he replied with
decision. “André de Nérac has chosen his party and
he will not be turned aside. Therefore the only other
course is to ruin him. Publish to the world that he is
Madame’s spy, that he has the key of Madame’s secret
passage in his pocket, publish what I have told you
and you compel me to keep a secret, and you can ruin
him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Denise drew a deep breath. Something like terror
shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I have information,” continued the Chevalier very
quietly, “that if made known to the King would ruin
the Vicomte to-night. Am I to use it or not? It is for
you, Marquise, to say.”</p>

<p>Denise’s lips paled. Her hand unconsciously crept
to her throat. “What sort of information?” she asked
in a dry whisper.</p>

<p>“That, Mademoiselle, must be my secret. But I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
not jest when I say that you can ruin Madame de
Pompadour to-day, but you will also most certainly
ruin the Vicomte de Nérac at the same time. Am I
to keep silent or to reveal the whole truth to the
Comte d’Argenson and the President of the Council of
Ministers?”</p>

<p>Denise stood pale and trembling. Her eyes looked
on her questioner with a dumb piteousness cruel to
behold.</p>

<p>“You have answered me, Marquise,” he replied after
an agitating pause. “I shall hold my tongue, and forgive
me, I beg, that I have been so merciless. But
love is merciless and blind.” He took her hand. “If
you doubt that a parvenu can love you better far than
he loves himself, think of my silence. When I am
driven from Versailles do not forget that I refused to
speak the truth of one who regards me as his enemy, at
your bidding. Adieu!”</p>

<p>In the doorway he paused to look back. For a moment
he wavered. Denise had stumbled to a chair and
was crying softly. “<i>Soit!</i>” he muttered, throwing up
his head, “<i>Soit!</i>” and humming a reckless catch he
strode down the gallery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE HEART OF THE POMPADOUR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> he had left Denise the Chevalier walked for
some time in the empty gallery up and down, up and
down, striving to master the strong emotion within.
But when at last he made his way into the gardens
he was once more the jaunty dare-devil cynic whose
fine blue eyes had made many a Court beauty feel
that even the veteran Vicomte de Nérac had lessons to
learn in the art of courtship. By the same Fountain
of Neptune where he had met Denise the Chevalier
now found a woman waiting, as indeed he expected.
Yet, greeting scarcely passed between them.</p>

<p>“You were right,” he began with bitter brevity,
“and you have had your way.”</p>

<p>The woman pondered on the reply. “Yes,” she said
presently. “I knew I was right. She loves him.
And you?” she added, with a swift touch of anxiety.</p>

<p>“I shall finish what I have begun,” he answered
with calm determination. “It will cost me my life,
perhaps, but,” his tone was savagely reckless, “revenge
is better than love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>The woman put her hand on his arm with affectionate
entreaty. “Why not,” she asked, “why not give it all
up? It is becoming too dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Dangerous? Of course. But it is too late to draw
back, and I will keep my oath now—now,” he repeated,
lingering on the word, “if I perish to-morrow.”
He put his hand quietly on her shoulder and looked
into her eyes. “You, too, some day will come to believe
that revenge is better than love.”</p>

<p>“At least we have no choice,” she answered with a
cruel little laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t! don’t,” the Chevalier whispered, in a sudden
tenderness. “What does it matter for me? but
you—you—I can’t bear it for you.”</p>

<p>“It is fate,” she said very quietly, “your fate and
mine.”</p>

<p>With his arm about her she stood in silence for no
small while. They were both thinking their own
thoughts, and they were not pleasant.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure he loves her?” the Chevalier
asked.</p>

<p>“I shall know for certain before many days,” she
answered, “although a woman feels sure now.”</p>

<p>They parted, as they had met, without greeting, but
had the Chevalier followed her he would have seen that
the woman went in the direction of “The Cock with
the Spurs of Gold.” It was probably because he already
knew this that he returned to the palace.</p>

<p>All this time Denise had sat crushed and sad, alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
in the antechamber. Nor did she know that André
had stood for some minutes in the doorway looking at
her, had twice stepped forward to speak, had twice restrained
himself, and finally had left her to her tears and
her silence.</p>

<p>But the one person whom he did not desire to meet
found him out by accident at that moment.</p>

<p>“Vicomte,” the Comtesse des Forges called softly,
“will you do me a favour?”</p>

<p>André smiled with skilful hypocrisy. The Comtesse
was looking her best, and her heavy-lidded eyes were
bright with admiration and an exquisite suggestion of
self-surrender. “A favour,” she repeated, “which
is also a secret. You will promise not to betray
me.”</p>

<p>André took her hand to his lips for answer. The
jewel on the lady’s breast gently rose and fell, echoing
tenderly the coy trembling of her fingers. It was not
the first time these two had played with passion, heedless
of the future, but André swiftly recognised that
this evening it would not be play, pastime, or pleasure.</p>

<p>“We have a petition to the King,” the Comtesse said
in her silkiest tones, “a petition from the Court praying
His Majesty to dismiss that woman, and we want
you to present it. His Majesty will listen to you more
than to any other.”</p>

<p>André still held her hand; the devotion in his face
was intended to conceal his thoughts. For the crisis
that he feared had come. This petition to the King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
from the Court was also an ultimatum to himself from
his friends.</p>

<p>“It will be useless,” he said gently, “the petition.”</p>

<p>“No—no! You can succeed with the King—you!
André,” she pleaded with a thrill of genuine passion,
“do it to please me. You know I can be grateful.”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” he replied, controlling himself, “not
even to please you, Gabrielle.”</p>

<p>“You will desert your friends and me—me?” she
asked, a menace creeping into her languorous voice.
“André, it is impossible, surely impossible.”</p>

<p>“I cannot present the petition,” he answered.</p>

<p>Jealousy, fear, anger, swept the passion out of her
eyes. “You are afraid?” she demanded, with biting
scorn.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am afraid,” he assented, and if the Comtesse
had not lost her self-control she must have detected the
delicate irony in his grave bow.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she stepped back. “Ah! If Denise had
asked you, you would have consented.”</p>

<p>“No,” he corrected with a freezing pride. “I
would not permit the Marquise de Beau Séjour even
to make the request.”</p>

<p>The answer surprised and delighted her. Yet, woman
though she was, the Comtesse failed to read what
lay behind it, and in her determination to win she now
made a stupid mistake. “I would save you, André,”
she whispered, “because—” she laid a jewelled hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
on his sleeve and dropped her eyes slowly. “They
will ruin you unless you consent.”</p>

<p>Why break with the past, the present, and the future?
André hesitated, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>“I cannot present the petition,” he answered curtly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she shrugged her shoulders in disdainful
wrath. “Very well. I shall not ask you a second
time. You understand; so do I.”</p>

<p>“Adieu!” he said, raising her fingers, but she
snatched them back and swept him a cold curtsey.</p>

<p>“<i>Soit!</i>” André was saying to himself as his spurs
rang in the empty corridor, “<i>c’est la guerre! Soit!</i>”
The die was cast. Madame de Pompadour was his
only friend now. Henceforward the Court, his friends,
his class, the women whom he had loved, would be his
bitterest foes. And it was to that one friend that he
now turned. Yet, careful as he was, he was unaware
that the Comtesse had followed him stealthily, had
marked his entry by the secret door, and returned to
the Duke of Pontchartrain with the news.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour was alone. “You have
something to say?” she questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>André related what had just passed and Madame
laughed. “Ah, my friend,” she remarked gaily, “it
will need more than a petition to-day.” She flung
herself back into her chair, her wonderful eyes ablaze
with a magnificently carnal consciousness of victorious
beauty and power. “And the Vicomte de Nérac cannot
go back now,” she added with a sudden gravity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
“The priests, the nobles, the officers might forgive you,
but a woman, a comtesse, will neither forget nor forgive,
never, never!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame,” André said, “I am in your
hands.”</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour moved swiftly towards him.
“And I in yours,” she whispered.</p>

<p>The perfect music of her voice, the grace of her figure,
the flash in her eyes, were irresistible. Compared
with this radiant, triumphant goddess of a royal love,
even Gabrielle des Forges seemed a bloodless, heartless
puppet.</p>

<p>“I have more to say,” André proceeded, “I verily
believe I am on the track of ‘No. 101.’” She turned
sharply, her breath came quickly. “Yvonne,” she
added, “Yvonne is proving very useful. I have learned
from her that the English have a spy, an agent in
Paris, that he frequents ‘The Cock with the Spurs of
Gold,’ that he has a paid servant at the palace. Before
long I mean to have that spy in fetters, and then——”
he laughed.</p>

<p>“Good—good!” Madame clapped her hands. “It
is only what I suspected. And the wench, Yvonne, is
she in it?”</p>

<p>“She is a simple girl, Madame, and I cannot say yet.
But in another week I shall know more.”</p>

<p>“Do not be in a hurry. It is pleasant cajoling the
truth from a wench, <i>n’est-ce pas?</i> We must act with
extreme caution, it is a matter of life and death for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
you and me. I, too, have not been idle. Listen.
The King’s secret is mine.”</p>

<p>André looked at her sorely puzzled. Madame invited
him to sit beside her on the settee. “What is
that secret?” she began. “Simply this: Behind the
ministers’ backs, contrary indeed to their despatches
and their public statements, His Majesty is intriguing
with the Jacobites and others too. More, His Majesty
both in Paris and elsewhere spies on his own servants
and frequently thwarts them. The Chevalier was his
secretary and confidant. But there will be no more
Chevalier. There will henceforth only be,” she sprung
up with a dramatic gesture, “the Marquise de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>“But why,” asked André slowly, “why does His
Majesty do it?”</p>

<p>“God knows. It is his foible, his passion. But so
long as he had secrets from me I was in constant peril.
To-day I have learned all that there is to know; and
now,” she paused, “and now, please Heaven, the King
will be in my hands alone.”</p>

<p>André was beginning to understand. “The King,
in fact,” he commented, “says one thing to the English
ministers who desire peace and another to the
Jacobites; that may prove desperately dangerous if it is
discovered.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And the master of his secret is master of
His Majesty. Ah, my friend, my foes are learning that
already, but it will need some sharper lessons before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
they submit. They shall have those lessons, I promise
you. I have accepted the challenge of the Court and
we shall see what we shall see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame,” André said with sincere admiration,
“you will be what you desire to be, the ruler of
France.”</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour drifted into a silent reverie.
The dreams could be read in her parted lips and faint
smile as the soft light played on every supple curve
which this woman’s genius knew how to suggest with
such subtle restraint.</p>

<p>“But one person can destroy me,” she remarked
presently; “‘No. 101.’”</p>

<p>André was startled by the gravity of her voice. “It
is the truth,” she was speaking now with nervous
rapidity. “If, which God forbid, the King’s secret intrigues
are betrayed by treachery, to save his honour
and himself he will, must, find a victim. That victim
will be I. Yes, yes, I know the game is dangerous,
but play it I must because the King insists. Vicomte,
‘No. 101’ must never, <i>never</i> succeed in securing
any of the King’s secrets as has happened in the
past.”</p>

<p>“Surely, Madame, you and I can prevent that.”</p>

<p>“Can we? Can we? Vicomte, I am not a coward
nor a fool, but I feel in the poisonous air of this Court,
surrounded by deadly enemies, my fate at the mercy of
the King’s caprice, that I am fighting not with flesh
and blood but with a foe mysterious, superhuman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
invincible. And I repeat, should the King’s secret be
betrayed by ‘No. 101’ to my enemies I am ruined.”</p>

<p>“I am confident,” André answered, “that not only
can I baffle that traitor but that I can discover him.”</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour studied his calm, handsome
face. Then the room seemed suddenly to swim in the
glories of a golden dawn. “My friend,” she cried,
holding out both her hands impulsively, “I believe
you. Did not Fontenoy teach me you are a man?”</p>

<p>“And it taught me—” he began softly.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she rippled over into an adorable coquetry.
“You are not the King yet, not yet, though—” it
was the <i>vivandière</i> of Fontenoy whose saucy eyes and
curtsey finished the sentence.</p>

<p>“When you are victorious, Madame,” André said,
“I shall ask for one favour.”</p>

<p>“Tut! only one! Dare I grant it beforehand?”</p>

<p>She was now the refined Marquise of a remorselessly
critical Versailles.</p>

<p>“You can take your revenge on the Court, Madame,
as you please, but you must spare,” she put down her fan
and waited anxiously, “the Marquise de Beau Séjour.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute.</p>

<p>“A woman, a haughty, petted beauty,” she murmured,
“and my bitterest foe. Are you aware that
Mademoiselle Denise is the soul of the party that
would destroy me, the close friend of the Chevalier de
St. Amant, and no friend to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Madame de Pompadour came close to him. “She is
not worthy of you,” she said quietly, “she does not
love you.”</p>

<p>“Madame, I love her.”</p>

<p>“And if I refuse to forego my just vengeance on
her?” she awaited his answer with anxiety wreathed
in tempting smiles.</p>

<p>“I will share her fate if she will permit it,” he answered
simply.</p>

<p>“Chivalrous fool!” she retorted, and she was not
wholly jesting. “No woman is worth the sacrifice of
such a man as you.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, Madame. Every man who loves a woman
perhaps is a fool, but the folly is a folly inspired by
God and it leads to heaven.”</p>

<p>The answer surprised her and for the moment she
faltered between tears and laughter. “I will not ask
again,” André said in a low voice, “for I trust you,
Marquise. Adieu!”</p>

<p>She hardly heeded his salute, and André was already
in the dark on the secret stairs when he felt a sharp
touch on his shoulder. “Be loyal to me, too!” she
whispered pleadingly into his ear. “Give me your
hand,” and she laid it on her breast. In the darkful
hush André could feel the fierce beating of that insurgent,
ambitious heart.</p>

<p>“Swear,” she whispered. “Swear with your hand
there that you will be loyal also to me, to Antoinette
de Pompadour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“I swear.” Two words, but two words between a
man and a woman can sweep a soul into hell or lift it
to heaven.</p>

<p>“The heart of the Pompadour,” she murmured.
“Can any man or woman read it? Can she read it
herself? God knows. Take care, take care of yourself,
my friend,” she added with a sudden wistful
pathos. “You alone I can trust. Adieu!”</p>

<p>“The heart of the Pompadour,” André muttered as
he stole back to the Queen’s apartments. “The heart
of the Pompadour.” What, indeed, was there not
written there of passion and ambition? Only a woman’s
heart. Yes, but one of the half-dozen women,
in the history of the world, the beatings of whose
heart have shaped the destinies of peoples and moulded
the fate of kingdoms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE FLOWER GIRL OF “THE GALLOWS AND THE
THREE CROWS”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">André</span> had understated the truth to Madame de
Pompadour when he said that he had learned much
from Yvonne. Bit by bit her simple confessions had
convinced him that “The Cock with the Spurs of
Gold” played an important part in the inscrutable mystery
of successful treachery summed up in the blood-stained
cipher of “No. 101.” Yvonne indeed sorely
puzzled him. She was only a hired wench at this hostelry
kept by a man and his wife against whom nothing
discreditable could be ferreted out. And he had utterly
failed to break down the barriers of her simplicity. She
related things she had seen or heard which to André
with his knowledge of the facts were damningly conclusive,
but that she was aware of this was contradicted
at every turn by her speech, her gestures, her amazing
innocence. In vain had he laid pitfall after pitfall to
catch her tripping. Not one syllable, one flutter of an
eyelid, one blush, one faltering tone, had rewarded his
cunningest or his most artless efforts. The girl had
passed ordeal after ordeal just as a peasant wench<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
should who was only a peasant wench. Yet every failure
only deepened the feeling that Yvonne was not
merely Yvonne of the Spotless Ankles; proof he had
none; proof indeed pointed to the very reverse. André
had nothing but a vague, indefinable, apparently irrational,
suspicion, and it maddened him. In the critical
struggle on which he had now embarked he was convinced
he was being beaten, tricked by a woman; she
held, if he were right, the keys which would unlock
the mystery and she was simply playing with him, no
doubt for her own ends; she was probably betraying
him daily to her accursed allies. Worse still, because
it was ridiculous as he felt it, there was an inexplicable
charm in this girl which threatened to master him.
Despite Denise and Madame de Pompadour and the
Comtesse des Forges and half a dozen other refined and
attractive women at the Court to inspire love and gratify
passion, he, André de Nérac, a Cordon Bleu, a
Croix de St. Louis, a noble of the Maison du Roi, was
in danger of falling a victim to an unkempt peasant
with a smudged face. Yvonne told him things eminently
useful, Yvonne baffled him, but these were
not the only reasons why daily he went to see her.
And he had discovered this humiliating fact by trying
to answer a torturing question. If he could prove
Yvonne to be a traitor or the ally of traitors, was he
ready to hand her over to the awful mercies of the
King’s justice? And if not, why not? Supposing he
could show that she was the woman who had foiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
him in the charcoal-burner’s cabin at Fontenoy, what
then? And his heart revolted in its answer against his
reason: “No, I cannot; I cannot leave Denise to the
vengeance of Madame de Pompadour, because I love
her; I cannot give Yvonne to the rack, the executioner’s
whip and wheel, because”—and then he always
stopped, because he had not the courage even in the
most intimate sanctuary of his conscience to finish the
answer.</p>

<p>But discover the mystery he must more than ever
now. His own fate and Madame de Pompadour’s
hung on success. The war was drawing to an end; the
negotiations for peace were beginning. If the King’s
secrets were betrayed as in the past Madame would be
disgraced. André had deliberately broken with his
friends and his order. Their implacable lust for vengeance
on the mistress would require his punishment
too. The issue was as clear as daylight. Either he
must crush them or they would crush him. And succeed
he must, because success alone meant safety, honour,
and the love of Denise.</p>

<p>And so, after leaving Madame de Pompadour, André
went as usual straight to Yvonne, whom he found in
the stalls feeding the spotted cow. “The Englishman,”
she informed him, “has been here, Monseigneur.
He spoke with a gentleman from the Court. I only
know that to-morrow night they will meet at a tavern
in Paris; they called it ‘The Gallows and the Three
Crows.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>André took the lantern from her and let the light fall
on her stained face.</p>

<p>“And this tavern, where is it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Yvonne met his gaze with the calmness of innocent
ignorance. “Monseigneur, I do not know. I have
never been in Paris.”</p>

<p>“You will swear you heard it as you say?”</p>

<p>“Surely. They said the name twice.”</p>

<p>“And the gentleman from the Court?”</p>

<p>“His cloak was over his face, but I think—I am certain—it
was Monsieur the Chevalier.”</p>

<p>André had heard enough. His blood was tingling
with passion and excitement. “You have done me a
great service, Yvonne,” he cried.</p>

<p>Yvonne very modestly disengaged the arm which for
the first time he had slipped about her supple waist.
“Monseigneur must not kiss me,” she whispered,
humbly. “I cannot betray my lover even to you,
sir.”</p>

<p>André started as if he had been detected in a crime.
“You have a lover, Yvonne?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The girl threw back her shock of matted hair and
laughed. “Many lovers,” she said, looking down at
her clumsy sabots, “but only one dares to kiss me.
Would it be wrong?” she inquired thoughtfully, “for
me to let Monseigneur kiss me, too?”</p>

<p>“No,” said André, still in the grip of passion.</p>

<p class="caption">Yvonne very modestly disengaged the arm which for the first time he

</figure>

<p>“Then Monseigneur will do as he pleases,” she answered
quietly. “I am his servant and,” she laughed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
“a peasant girl would remember the kiss of a grand
gentleman who has surely kissed many great ladies.”</p>

<p>There was no satire in her voice, and the roguish
gleam in her eyes was simply bright with an innocent
vanity, yet the words fell like ice-cold water on molten
steel.</p>

<p>“Damn her!” was André’s savage comment as he
galloped back to the palace. Was she playing with
him or was it sheer <i>naïveté</i> of soul?—for as usual
Yvonne had in her mysterious way lured him on and
then administered a humiliating rebuke.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The tavern with the grim name of “The Gallows
and the Three Crows” lay in the mouth of a slum on
the south side of the river, and when André, cloaked
and disguised to the best of his power, entered its dark
parlour he recognised that the police were not wrong
in telling him it was partly a gaming hell, partly the
haunt of the select of the scum, male and female, of
Paris, the rendezvous for the low amours of bullies,
sharpers, and broken gentry, and the women who were
their victims or their tools. He felt that the half-dozen
occupants of the room eyed his swaggering entry with
the keenest interest, but it was not his first introduction
to such resorts, and a soldier of half a dozen campaigns
and a swordsman of his quality knew no fear. Nor
was the wine so bad, and the flower girl who impudently
took a seat at once at his table, though he could scarcely
see her face in the gloom, promised some pleasant fun,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
when she had ceased to turn her back on him and
to chaff a man at the next table.</p>

<p>Nothing in particular, however, happened until a
figure heavily cloaked rose from the further corner, and
as he passed the flower girl tapped her familiarly on the
shoulder. She looked up, started unmistakably, and
André noticed the man had tried to slip a piece of paper
into her basket of flowers. Unnoticed by both, the paper
fell on the dirty sanded floor among the refuse, and
in a trice André had his foot on it.</p>

<p>He felt his heart beating like a sledge hammer. He
had caught a glimpse of the man’s face—the same face
that had puzzled him behind the trees near “The
Cock with the Spurs of Gold.” Ah! the memories
rushed in on him. Yes; he remembered now, of course,
he had seen that face in the glare of the flaming charcoal-burner’s
cabin and in London at a supper party.
It was the face of George Onslow, an Englishman.
Yvonne had not been mistaken. Onslow was the English
spy in Paris. Onslow at Fontenoy had come to
receive the plans from “No. 101.” Ha! should he
follow him? Yes? No? Before he could decide he
recognised two other men drinking carelessly but
stealthily watching the room. These were servants,
trusted servants, of the Duke de Pontchartrain and the
Comte de Mont Rouge. What the devil were they
doing here? By accident, or to meet some wench
of the town, or as spies on whom or what?</p>

<p>George Onslow had meanwhile disappeared. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
flower girl, too, humming a catch, was slipping away.
André stooped to pick up the piece of paper, but by
the time he had reached the door, pest on her nimble
heels, she, too, had vanished! And André was only
conscious that the two servants were following him out.
Ah, that was their game, was it? Calling for another
bottle of wine, he went back to the table, and immediately
the pair returned to their seat. That was conclusive.
They were there to watch him, but why?
Clearly because the Court desired to know of all his
movements. The consequences of his refusal to the
Comtesse des Forges were in fact beginning. André
smiled grimly, stretched out his legs and examined the
precious slip of paper. At once his heart pounded the
more fiercely. The scrap had no writing on it at all;
all that he could see was a curious symbol, two crossed
daggers and the figures “101” in red ink—no, blood!
There was no mistaking it—blood. The mysterious
traitor’s sign, pass, or counterword. He set his teeth.
Why, oh, why had he allowed that girl to escape him?</p>

<p>An hour passed. Nothing happened, and André
goaded by a feverish curiosity which he could not
satisfy, and feeling only that he had been baffled again,
planned how to leave. Pausing, to be sure that the two
servants were ready as before to follow him, he flung
himself round the corner into the darkness and up the
first alley and down the next, reckless of stabs in the
back, until he was able to crouch in the first convenient
doorway. He had thrown his spies off, that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
something, and just as he was wondering what to do
next a cloaked figure brushed past him. The Chevalier
de St. Amant, as he lived! He grabbed at the cloak in
vicious rage. The Chevalier at least should not escape
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so rude, Vicomte,” laughed a woman’s
voice. “I won’t vanish up the chimney.”</p>

<p>André, in sheer astonishment, staggered against the
door, glaring all the time into the darkness. “You will
be wise to follow me,” she continued, “and in silence.”</p>

<p>In two minutes the pair were standing in a small and
empty back room of the tavern André had just left.
The woman threw back her hood, revealing the trim
figure and saucy face of the impudent flower girl, who
was no other than his long-lost acquaintance, the
crystal-gazer.</p>

<p>“You will present,” she said mockingly, “my humble
duties to Madame la Marquise de Pompadour——”</p>

<p>André had recovered his bewilderment. “What is
the meaning of that?” he demanded, brusquely, thrusting
the slip of paper into her hands.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she retorted coolly, and then tore
the slip into a dozen pieces, “and I do not care to
know.”</p>

<p>André was so startled by the studied insolence of the
act that for a few minutes he could neither speak nor
move. When he did, it was to put his back to the door
very significantly.</p>

<p>“One question, Madame,” he demanded. “You are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
aware that George Onslow is in Paris, that he spoke to
you, gave you that paper?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Mr. Onslow mistook me for some one
else. I have just convinced him of his mistake.” She
was positively smiling.</p>

<p>“You expect me to believe that?”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “No,” she answered,
“the truth told by women is never believed, least of all
at Versailles by men.”</p>

<p>André ran his eye over her. As in the past, so now
something in her voice and figure reminded him of
some one else, but of whom he could not recall.
“Madame,” he said earnestly, “I urge you to tell the
truth. You were never in such danger as you are
now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But I am not in such peril as you
are, Monsieur le Vicomte.”</p>

<p>Instinctively he turned sharply round. The woman
laughed and the laugh maddened him, for they were
alone and the door had been locked by himself.</p>

<p>“My friend,” she said quietly, “you are being spied
on. To-morrow the ministers, the Comtesse des
Forges, and the Comte de Mont Rouge will know how
the Vicomte de Nérac, who gave out he was going to
visit Madame his aged mother, has spent the evening
in the company of Mr. George Onslow and disreputable
women. I feel sure the Marquise de Beau Séjour
will hear it, too, with additions.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said André, stonily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Monsieur le Vicomte also is known to frequent the
society of one Yvonne. Innocent peasant girls, when
put on the rack, are sometimes obliged to tell lies, poor
things, but lies useful to those who rack them. The
Marquise de Beau——”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not. Monsieur le Vicomte is also the
lover of Madame de Pompadour. You deny it? Then
why go in the darkness with the King’s private key to
her apartment? The noble whose arm you slit will
enjoy taking that delightful scandal about the Captain
of the Queen’s Guards to the King, and the King—<i>mon
Dieu!</i> the King—” she laughed bloodthirstily,
nor was it necessary to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>André wiped the sweat off his brow. The woman
came close to him. “Supposing,” she said in a low
voice, “supposing you had been arrested to-night with
that slip of paper in your pocket, would all your services,
all your oaths, your nobility, have saved you?
Think, my friend, think. I did a bold thing, perhaps,
in destroying it, but it was in your interest, Vicomte,
not mine.”</p>

<p>André was silent, appalled at her knowledge. The
tables had been turned on him with a vengeance, and
this astonishing woman was right, which was hardest
of all.</p>

<p>“You would know,” she proceeded, divining marvellously
his confused thoughts, “how I have all this
information. I have my crystal,” she laughed, “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
I also hate the King and the woman who rules him.
You and she are not the only persons at Versailles to
whom it is a matter of life and death to discover the
secret of ‘No. 101.’ Monsieur, I am the paid agent of
the foes of that wanton, the King’s mistress, and of
yourself.”</p>

<p>Unconsciously André’s fingers clutched the hilt of
his sword.</p>

<p>“Why do I tell you all this?” she asked in a low
voice. “Does that confession amuse or startle you?
Am I the first woman who would sacrifice herself for
the Vicomte de Nérac or the first to confess her love?
No. And to prove I speak the truth I will reveal to
you the secret of ‘No. 101’ that I alone have discovered,
but on one condition”—she paused to put her hands on
both his shoulders—“that you will promise from this
moment to abandon Mademoiselle Denise, who is not
worthy of you, and to love me alone.”</p>

<p>Dead silence. André stood hypnotised, half by fear,
half by the witchery of her womanhood.</p>

<p>“I have beauty, wealth, power,” she whispered
caressingly. “Yes, I am as fair a woman as Mademoiselle
Denise; I can make you a greater man than
Madame de Pompadour can; I can reveal to you the
secret that is worth the ransom of the King’s crown;
and I love you. Say yes, André, for your own sake;
you will never regret it.”</p>

<p>André looked into her blue eyes, so resplendent
against the cream tint of her skin, and at her magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
black hair. Passion and ambition began to sap
his will. Then slowly he dragged himself from his intoxicating
dream and disengaged her hands.</p>

<p>“No,” he said gently but firmly, “I do not love
you. I cannot—I cannot, because,” his voice rang out,
“I love Denise.”</p>

<p>She was trembling, he thought, with rage, but there
was no rage in her eyes, only a mysterious pity and
pathos as of a woman who had staked all on one throw
and lost, yet was not wholly sorry.</p>

<p>“Ah! well,” she said, controlling herself. “I know
now that you will never discover the secret of ‘No.
101’—never!”</p>

<p>“I shall,” he answered, with unfaltering confidence,
“I shall succeed because I must.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders with scorn. “Open
that window,” she commanded, in the most matter-of-fact
tone, “before you leave you had better be sure the
King’s police are not waiting for you.”</p>

<p>With the key of the door in his pocket André
quietly threw the shutters open and peered out.</p>

<p>“Well? No one?” said a voice at his elbow. “I
fear, Vicomte, I cannot wait while you make up your
mind what you will do with me. You will hear interesting
news at Versailles to-morrow. Thank you.
Good-night!”</p>

<p>A sharp push, the vision of two small boots, and a
flutter of short skirts, and she had lightly vaulted into
the street. When André recovered his balance the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
darkness of the network of slums had swallowed her.
Tricked and baffled again by a woman, and with these
questions above all crying out for an answer: why had
he mistaken her for the Chevalier? Was she really in
love with him? And was she an agent of the plotters
against Madame de Pompadour?</p>

<small>AT HOME WITH A CIPHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Midnight</span> had struck, the same night, more than
an hour ago; the black and squalid Carrefour of St.
Antoine was deserted; the houses that fringed it lay in
darkness, yet in the main salon of one of them, though
they could not be discerned by a passer-by, the lights
still blazed, for the shutters were closed and bolted, the
thick double curtains were drawn tight. On the table
in the centre of the room were ample traces that two
persons had recently supped, and supped sumptuously.
But there was only one now in the room, a woman
copying from a roll of manuscript, and absorbed in her
task. Save for the monotonous tick of the clock, and
a curious muffled murmur which trickled through a
door that faced the main entry, the silence in the
strangely brilliant glare of the numerous candelabra
was oppressively eery. Presently the woman threw
down her pen and walked with a quick but graceful
step in front of one of the many long mirrors that lined
the walls. She inspected herself with a charmingly insolent
cynicism. The glass, with truthful admiration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
flashed back the reflection of a supple and exquisitely
moulded figure, fair hair, bright blue eyes, and a skin
on face, neck, and shoulders amazingly delicate in its
blended tints of snow and rose. A young woman this,
in the heyday of health and beauty, noble of birth, too,
if the refinement of her features, and the ease and dignity
of her carriage, did not strangely lie; and at every
movement the costly jewels in her hair and on her
breast, in her artfully simple dress, and on her fingers,
only heightened the challenge to the homage claimed
by her youth and beauty. Very soon, however, she
ceased to find pleasure in looking at herself. A soft
pathos swept over the artificial audacity of her eyes and
lips. She sat down, her elbows on her knees, then
stretched her arms wearily and sighed that most pathetic
of all sighs, a sigh from a young woman’s
heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang up, and, after listening attentively,
seized a hand lamp and left the room. When
she returned, it was with a man, who flung off his cloak
and stood blinking now at her, now at the brilliant
lights.</p>

<p>“So it is you they have sent?” she said contemptuously;
“you!”</p>

<p>“I volunteered,” George Onslow answered, “because
I wanted to come.” His gaze lingered hungrily
on her. “And, by God! I am glad. You,” he laughed
wearily, “you pretend you are not?”</p>

<p>“What does it matter to me whom your accursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
government sends? Any man is better than a woman,
such women, at least, as they employed last time.”</p>

<p>His eyes roamed from her jewels to the supper
table.</p>

<p>“You have had company to-night, Enchantress?”
he asked in a flash of jealousy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered over her shoulder, “two can
make very good company—sometimes. But here is
what you wanted. Take it and go.”</p>

<p>He scanned the roll of manuscript eagerly, his eyes
sparkling.</p>

<p>“You have not signed,” he remarked, half jestingly.</p>

<p>The woman opened a penknife and pushed back the
lace which fringed her splendid arm at the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” cried Onslow, in genuine pain. “I can’t
bear——”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” With the few drops of blood produced by
the knife she made a symbol with her pen on the roll.
“From as near my heart as any man will ever get anything,”
she said, replacing the lace again. “And now
my pay, please.”</p>

<p>Onslow handed her a small bag of gold, which she
locked in a drawer. “You will drink,” she continued,
pouring out two glasses of wine. “Your health, skulking
spy, and damnation to Louis XV. and all his crew
of my fascinating sex!”</p>

<p>“To your trade and mine, <i>ma mignonne</i>, to yourself
and—to the damnation of Louis XV.!” He drained
his glass, refilled it, and drained it again. “You are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
witch,” he cried, tapping the roll. “How do you do
it?”</p>

<p>“Come this way and I will show you.”</p>

<p>She opened the side door, revealing a small room lit
by a single candle. On the bed lay a man bound hand
and foot, and gagged. One boot was off, showing
whence the despatch had been taken. “A confidential
messenger of the King whose damnation you have just
drunk,” she explained, with careless calm, “and like
all secret agents the prey of his passions. He went
from my supper table—or rather I carried him—like
that. There will be a pother in Versailles to-morrow
or next day. It is not only at the palace, you see,
that a beautiful woman can ruin a kingdom.”</p>

<p>She slammed the door behind her and admired herself
in the mirror, while George Onslow’s glowing eyes
gloated on the superb picture that the mirror and she
made under the blazing candles.</p>

<p>“You are a wonderful woman,” he said softly.</p>

<p>“I am not a woman, I am only a number.”</p>

<p>“As I think I told you when I saw you last in
London.”</p>

<p>She wheeled suddenly. “And because you were
such a fool as to show you had discovered it,” she
retorted, “I could send you to-night, or any night, to
be broken on the executioner’s wheel. Exactly.”</p>

<p>“It baffles me why you do it,” he muttered, ignoring
the remark.</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you. For three hundred and sixty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
days in the year I am a cipher, a sexless vagrant, unknown
and a mystery; but for five days maybe I wear
my jewels and am a woman rejoicing in my health and
my beauty. These are my woman’s hours, glorious
hours. That is one reason; the other is—revenge!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” He rubbed his hands appreciatively.</p>

<p>“And you?” she asked, with a faint smile of the
most tempting provocation.</p>

<p>“For love,” he spoke with a hint of pain. “To the
world you are a mysterious number, but to me you are
the most beautiful, most splendid woman on earth, without
whose love I cannot live. Had you not by chance
crossed my path I would have dropped this dirty felon’s
game, but I go on and shall go on, taking my chance
of the wheel, the halter, or the footpad’s death in the
gutter, till you are mine, wholly mine.”</p>

<p>Her lip curled. “The wine is getting into your
head,” she said, in her passionless tones. “In your
trade and mine that is dangerous. Remember the fate
of all who, knowing what you know, have seen my
face; remember your friend, Captain Statham, who
recognised the Princess in the hut near Fontenoy.
Love? Love? You are a strong, vile animal of a man
tempted by mere beauty of body. But I am not an
animal, nor a woman as women are in Paris, London,
Vienna. Love? a man’s animal love? Think you if
that was what I could feel or wanted I would be to-day
a thief of state secrets, a cipher, a skulker from justice?
No, I would be the mistress of the King of France and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
would rule a great kingdom. And you have the insolence
to offer me the caresses of a felon, a spy, a traitor.
You are mad.”</p>

<p>“It is you who made me and keep me mad, thank
God!”</p>

<p>She sat down, beckoning him to sit beside her.
“Now listen,” she said calmly. “The game is up.
There will be no more papers for a long time. Why?
Because my foes are on my track. The toils are being
drawn around me. My sources of information are being
discovered and stopped. And—” she paused—“and
a man worth ten of you, unless I am very careful,
will——”</p>

<p>“The Vicomte de Nérac?” he gasped out. “Curse
him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Vicomte de Nérac, who balked you at
Fontenoy.”</p>

<p>“You let him balk us—you did.”</p>

<p>“And if I did for my own ends, what then?”</p>

<p>“You love him? Answer! Answer or——”</p>

<p>“What is it to you? He is worth a woman’s love.
But, my good friend, he does not love me. Give me
your hand!” she suddenly commanded, soothing him
at the same time by a caressing look. “Ah! I thought
so. There is death, a violent death, in that palm of
yours, death coming soon. And yet, my friend, you
can avert it. But unless you take my advice and forget
me from this night, unless you cease to be a spy
and a traitor, before long you will have to reckon with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
the Vicomte de Nérac—it is written there—and then—”
She let his hand drop with icy indifference, “<i>c’est fini
pour vous!</i>”</p>

<p>“A fig for your old wives’ fables! I have sworn you
shall be mine and you shall.”</p>

<p>“Stand back!” She sprang up.</p>

<p>“No!” For one minute he faced her and then,
with a hunter’s cry on his prey, he had pinioned her
wrist, and in that besotted grip she was powerless,
though she struggled fiercely.</p>

<p>“No, <i>ma mignonne</i>, I, too, am strong. You shall
learn you are only a weak woman after all.” He had
whipped the dagger from its concealment by her heart,
his arm was about her, his eyes the eyes of a victorious
maniac.</p>

<p>“Kiss me at your will,” she murmured faintly.
“See, <i>mon ami</i>, I resist no longer. Yes, you, too, are
a man. I was only tempting you. I am not a number,
but a woman. You have my secret, and I am
yours!” No man could have resisted the intoxicating
self-surrender in her eyes and voice, least of all George
Onslow in the grip of unholy passion long thwarted.</p>

<p>Suddenly her released fingers closed like a vise on
his throat. In vain he struggled, for he was choking.
Her great natural strength was duplicated by rage and
an insulted womanhood. She forced him on to the
ground, livid, gasping for breath, and put a knee on
his chest. “Mercy!” he faltered, “Mercy!”</p>

<p>With her left hand she tore the lace from her breast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
and gagged him inch by inch. With her right hand
still on his throat she produced a rope from her pocket
and tied with practised skill his hands and feet. Then
she rose and calmly rearranged her disordered dress
and hair and quickly searched him for pistols and
dagger.</p>

<p>“Carrion! scum!” she whispered, bending over him,
“you deserve to die like the English dog you are.
Miserable, insolent libertine!” and she struck him on
the cheek. “No, I will not kill you, for you have my
work to do and you shall do it. But a weak woman
has taught you a lesson and your hour is not yet come.
Another shall soil his hands or his sword with your
rascallion blood. Go!”</p>

<p>She dragged him down the passages, loosened the
rope on his ankles till he could just hobble, flung his
coat about him, and with her dagger at his throat
pushed him to the open door, where she propped him
against the wall in the damp darkness of the court, and
the silent serenity of the stars.</p>

<p>“It will take you,” she said pleasantly, “twenty
minutes to bite through that cord, and by that time I
shall have disappeared for ever from your sight. But
remember my advice, or as sure as you stand here, before
long my secret will die with you.” She drew the
lace gag from his mouth and stuffed it inside his collar.
“Cry out now if you please,” she continued contemptuously,
“and my secret will die with you in two days
on the executioner’s wheel. Oh, keep the lace; it came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
from a woman’s heart, and on the scaffold will be a
pleasant souvenir of a night of love with a cipher.
Adieu!”</p>

<p>The outer door was locked. The woman who was
a cipher had disappeared; whence and whither, who
could say?</p>

<p>As George Onslow stood with rage, jealousy, baffled
passion, humiliation, surging within him, he was startled
by the sudden appearance of a stranger.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” said the boyish voice of the
Chevalier de St. Amant. “’Tis a friend.” He muttered
a reassuring password. “So that woman has
treated you as she treated me?” In a trice he had set
the helpless spy free.</p>

<p>Onslow’s answer was an incoherent growl of gratitude,
surprise, and relief.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Chevalier, “we are in the same
boat. You will hear from me shortly, I promise you.
And then you and I can have our revenge on her and
the Vicomte de Nérac. Revenge, my friend, revenge
will be sweet. Meanwhile have courage, and be careful
till our turn comes!”</p>

<p>And then he, too, glided away to be lost in the night
that divined and protected all the treachery and treason,
all the dreams of love and hate, of passion and
ambition, the tears and laughter and prayers that
throbbed then, and will always throb, in the heart of
Paris.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>THE KING’S COMMISSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">André</span> was not the only person at Versailles who,
tortured with perplexity and fear, must now choose between
loyalty to a cause or loyalty to the dictates of the
heart. Poor Denise, whose womanhood, nobility, and
devotion to her neglected and insulted Queen made
her so bitter a foe of Madame de Pompadour, whose
sensitive self-respect and self-reverence, whose ideal of
purity so strange in the world of Versailles, whose indignation
at André’s desertion to the side of the ambitious
mistress, had combined to make her despise and
twice reject the hero of her girlhood; yes, poor Denise
had at last been driven by a cruel necessity to acknowledge
to herself and to the Chevalier that she really
loved André, and that she could not sacrifice him even
to victory over Madame de Pompadour. Ever since
that hour of misery she had bitterly blamed herself for
her selfish weakness. She had not only been untrue to
her own cause, but perhaps had ensured its defeat—and
for what? Because she loved, despite all, one who did
not love her. And unless she made atonement for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
folly and sin she must forfeit her own self-respect for
ever and be punished as well. Denise, therefore,
goaded by remorse, by a dim hope of saving André at
the last hour, had steeled herself to conquer her pride
and her modesty and to speak to André himself.</p>

<p>He, too, oppressed with misgivings and fears, had
returned early in the morning to Versailles, and when
he found himself alone in the antechamber with Denise,
pale and resolute, instinct warned him as it warned her
that both their lives might now turn on silence or
speech.</p>

<p>“Will you answer a question?” she began with nervous
directness.</p>

<p>He bowed with a singularly poor attempt at resolute
indifference.</p>

<p>“Why,” she demanded in a low voice, “why did
you say you were going to Nérac when you really
meant to visit a low cabaret in Paris?”</p>

<p>André had no answer ready, for it was not the question
he had been expecting from Denise.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, after a pitiful pause, “that you are
well informed, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>Denise looked round the room as if to make sure
they were not being spied on. Then she walked towards
him, her trembling fingers revealing her emotion.</p>

<p>“I will tell you why I ask,” she said. “This morning,
at three o’clock, in the gutter outside the cabaret—where
you were seen at midnight—one of the King’s
messengers was discovered by the police, gagged and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
bound, and his despatches gone—stolen, of course, by
the traitor who has done this felon’s work before.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” The horror in his face was unmistakable,
but was it due to guilty knowledge or innocent
surprise? The crystal-gazer’s last words, “There will
be news in the morning for you at Versailles,” were
ringing in his ears, and now he stared dully and confused
at the girl’s pale face.</p>

<p>“You do not wish to tell me,” Denise continued,
“why you went to that cabaret?”</p>

<p>With the memory of the night still painfully vivid,
aware how his path was beset by pitfalls, André was
trying to decide whether Denise was asking as the
agent of his implacable foes or for herself alone.</p>

<p>“You,” she began again, “are the Captain of the
Queen’s Guards; you visit by stealth at an inn a wench
called Yvonne, you refused to present our petition to
the King, you visit a cabaret frequented by a foreigner
suspected of being an English spy, under whose walls
foul treason is committed, and you professed to have
gone to Nérac”—she paused, and looked at him wistfully.
“Why do you do these things?”</p>

<p>“To discover the traitor; that is my reason,” he answered.</p>

<p>“At the request of His Majesty?” she asked swiftly
and significantly.</p>

<p>Should he lie to Denise? André’s troubled eyes
passionately sought her face.</p>

<p>“I can say no more,” he replied slowly, and Denise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
though she knew that he had admitted her accusation,
was glad he had not told her a falsehood.</p>

<p>“Do you know that you are in extreme danger?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it.” He spoke with great gravity.</p>

<p>“I have been unjust to you,” she said quickly; “unjust
and unkind. I am more than grateful for your
generosity and honour in saving me by that duel. I
am ready now to believe your word just because it is
yours. They tell me you are the lover of Madame de
Pompadour and at heart a traitor, but it is a lie—a lie!”</p>

<p>“Ah!”—it was a true lover’s cry of joy—“a lie,
Denise!”</p>

<p>“Yes, a lie. I say so to you because I have said it
to them. André, will you for your own sake—I cannot
and will not ask for mine—will you not refuse now and
henceforth to be the servant and ally of Madame de
Pompadour? Will you not help me instead in the cause
which is the cause of your nobility and mine—of honesty
and honour?”</p>

<p>“I could wish,” he answered earnestly, “for your
sake, Denise, that you would refuse to have any part
in this squalid struggle for power. Believe me, it is no
task for a woman such as we—I—would have you be.”</p>

<p>“Do not I know it?” she answered wearily. “To
the woman I would be it is hateful. It soils—it soils,”
she cried in a low voice of anguish. “But take my
place, André, and I promise you I will leave Versailles
for Beau Séjour till”—she looked up timidly, unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
to check the tender radiance in her appealing eyes—“till
you come to tell me you are victorious and she has
gone for ever.”</p>

<p>André had taken her outstretched hands. Her words
were like wine to a fainting man. Denise loved him—Denise
loved him! Last night with another woman’s
hands on his shoulders, a woman promising him love,
success, glory, the great secret whose fascination was
so irresistible, he had refused to succumb to temptation,
and Denise’s look even more than her words was now
his reward. He had only to promise and she would be
in his arms for ever. And so for a few blissful moments
of oblivion to the perils that beset them both he stood
with her dear hands in his, her face close to his, supremely
happy, as she was.</p>

<p>Suddenly they both stepped back. Some one had
stealthily entered—only a lackey peeping cautiously,
but a lackey, they both recognised at once, of Madame
de Pompadour.</p>

<p>“Whom do you seek?” Denise demanded haughtily.</p>

<p>The man had obviously expected to find André
alone. He now tried to sidle away.</p>

<p>“If,” said the Marquise de Beau Séjour, “you have
a message for Monsieur le Vicomte de Nérac, give it
to him.”</p>

<p>The man, thus sternly commanded, reluctantly
handed André a small note and fled.</p>

<p>“Read it, I beg,” Denise urged, her tone unconsciously
cold and severe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>It was sealed with the crest of the Marquise de Pompadour,
and André read these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I must see you at once.—<span class="smcap">A. de P.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The crumpled note fell from his fingers. Ah!
Sooner or later he had known even in his great bliss
that he must answer Denise’s appeal, but this message
made a decision imperative.</p>

<p>“Will you save me as I asked you?” Denise said,
and once again she came close to him.</p>

<p>“And if I cannot promise to take your place?” he
questioned to gain time.</p>

<p>“Then I must go on alone—alone,” she answered,
“and God knows what I may do.”</p>

<p>Ambition, loyalty, love, his pledged oath to Madame
de Pompadour, fear, remorse, and pain struggled
within him.</p>

<p>“I will promise anything, anything but that,” he
cried in despair.</p>

<p>“It is the only thing that can help,” she said very
quietly: “but it is well I should know the truth. I
thank you for that.” Tears were in her voice. “Do
not think the worse of me if—” she stopped. Words
failed her. Fate and the mistakes of the past of each
were too strong for him and for her.</p>

<p>And then, André, unable to endure the misery
longer, without a syllable of explanation or justification,
left her.</p>

<p>Denise’s eye fell on the note from the woman who she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
felt had ruined her life and his. For one minute she
held it in her fingers. Her friends would give much
for this damning evidence of his guilt. If she desired
revenge, here was the chance; and she was, alas!
racked by the jealousy and curiosity of a woman who
loved and had been rejected; but it was only for a
moment that she wavered, then with a proud sadness
tore the note into fragments and threw them on the fire.
Not till the last had been burnt did she take refuge in
the hopeless loneliness of her own room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” exclaimed Madame de Pompadour,
as André stepped from behind the curtains of the secret
door, “<i>Mon Dieu!</i> my friend, I am not the devil, that
you should look at me like that.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” André replied, “I am here to receive
your commands.”</p>

<p>A jest, a taunt, a direct question, hovered on the
lady’s lips. But after another searching look, instead
she held out a hand of swift and strong sympathy.</p>

<p>“Courage, Vicomte,” she said softly, “do not despair.
I am not beaten yet, nor are you. No woman
can forget a man’s loyalty, certainly not I.”</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour was a selfish and ambitious
woman, yet to a few such nature has granted the mysterious
power of expressing in word and look what they
do not really feel. Then, as always in her unique
career, it proved the most potent of her many
gifts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“I thank you, Marquise,” André replied, deeply
touched.</p>

<p>“You have heard the news,” she said, wisely returning
to business. “Yes? Could anything be worse?
But thank Heaven the messenger was carrying only
public despatches. Had it been one of the King’s
secrets you and I would not be talking here.”</p>

<p>“And His Majesty?”</p>

<p>“Is one moment furiously angry, at another plunged
in the deepest dejection, at another jesting. This accursed
treachery appalls him. No wonder. But, as the
business of last night affects the ministers more than
himself, he is angry with them alone. Cursed dullards,
he called them in this very room, infamous bunglers.
I think,” she added, smiling, “His Majesty will presently
see it is his interest to give some of them change
of air and occupation. Who knows, the Vicomte de
Nérac may be Minister for War yet.”</p>

<p>André laughed grimly. That would be a triumphant
retort indeed to the Court that hoped to prove him a
traitor and a libertine.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour ceased to smile. Fear and
anxiety made her voice and eyes grave. “‘No. 101,’”
she said, “has given the King occasion to call his ministers
dullards and bunglers. If to-morrow, thanks to
‘No. 101,’ the King should have reason to call me that
and worse, you and I are ruined. You follow me?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, Madame.”</p>

<p>“<i>Eh bien!</i> it is necessary for His Majesty to communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
with the Jacobites. That, unhappily, is not my
affair. His Majesty wills it so, and I, who alone know
this, must obey. This is the despatch.”</p>

<p>André took the sheet of paper. “It is in your handwriting,
Madame!” he exclaimed, in sharp astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wrote it at the King’s dictation this morning.
Have you forgotten I, alone, am his confidential secretary
now?” She quietly folded the paper, sealed it
with her own private seal, and wrote a direction on the
cover.</p>

<p>“You wish me to be the bearer?” André asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“Three persons alone,” she replied quietly, “know
of this despatch and its contents—the King, you, and
I. The King cannot deliver it. It must, therefore, be
you or I. With ‘No. 101’ out there or here in the palace
we cannot trust any messenger. That is the price
you and I have to pay for the power we have
won.”</p>

<p>“I will take it,” André said at once.</p>

<p>“Reflect, my friend,” she answered. “If that despatch
is found on your person, or stolen, it reveals an
intrigue with the Jacobites in defiance of the King’s
public promise and the policy of his ministers, and you
will go to the Bastille as a traitor. It is in my handwriting,
sealed with my seal, and the King will disavow
us both; therefore, I shall follow you to prison and
death. This is a more dangerous errand than my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
commission at Fontenoy. You can risk it and will,
but is it fair?”</p>

<p>“Madame, if you were not involved, I should welcome
the Bastille and the scaffold,” he replied.</p>

<p>She flashed a swift look, piercing to the marrow, and
she read how the iron of some unknown fate had entered
into his soul; but with marvellous self-restraint
she suppressed her curiosity.</p>

<p>“I thank you,” she said; “no, I cannot thank you,
but some day I will.”</p>

<p>It is not given to many men to see in such a woman’s
eyes what André saw then. He wrenched himself
into asking an obvious question.</p>

<p>“The agent of the Jacobites will be at midnight at
‘The Cock with the Spurs of Gold,’” she answered.
“Do not be surprised; it is not I who have chosen that
place; it is the King, and we must obey. Paris is too
far off; the road and the city are as we know only too
full of dangers. Remember that before you deliver the
despatch the agent will give you the password, ‘<i>Discret
et fidèle</i>,’ and show you a seal like this. Yes, keep it.”
She handed him an impression of the private royal seal.
“And now I will sew the paper into your inside pocket;
it is the safest way I can think of.”</p>

<p>For a couple of minutes she stitched in the most
businesslike way, but neither he nor she could make
the operation other than it was.</p>

<p>What a beautiful woman! André was only human,
indeed more susceptible than most to physical charm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
The flutter of her eyelids, the lights that unconsciously
came and went in her eyes, the dimple in the cheek,
the rounded curve of neck, shoulder, and arm—veritably
a <i>morceau de roi</i>.</p>

<p>“They say,” she whispered, with a roguish laugh,
“that poor fool of a messenger was cajoled off his
errand by a petticoat. Women, you know, are often
surprised at the extraordinary weakness of even strong
men. I wonder if any woman could make you,
Vicomte, betray yourself. Perhaps?”</p>

<p>“I hope not.” André found it wiser to jest too.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi!</i> I should like to try.”</p>

<p>André kissed her fingers with the unconscious grace
that was vainly imitated by all the young courtiers of
Versailles. “I could only succumb to your equal, Marquise,”
he said, “but such a woman does not exist.
Therefore I shall succeed.”</p>

<p>“You must; you must.”</p>

<p>“Madame, the paper will be delivered safely or I
shall never return.”</p>

<p>The thoughts of both had soared away in the sudden
silence, and across the unconquerable dreams of ambition
and love there fell the sinister, blood-stained mystery
of the unknown traitor and darkened the room.</p>

<p>“God keep you, my friend,” Madame murmured.
“God keep you safe!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>ON SECRET SERVICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> clock in André’s room struck eleven. André
pulled the curtains back and surveyed the night.
Serene, flawlessly serene, as an October night at Versailles
can be. Satisfied that his pistols were properly
primed, that the precious despatch was still in his
pocket, he blew out the lights and then by a rope ladder
swung himself out of the window. His experience at
“The Gallows and the Three Crows” had warned him
that for his foes to discover the King’s commission was
for Madame de Pompadour and himself ruin, death,
and dishonour. And he was determined the Court
should not so much as know he had left the palace.
So at midday he had given out that he was ill, had even
sent for a physician, and then had quietly slept till the
hour had come. And now that he had successfully
given them the slip the Captain of the Queen’s Guards
laughed as a truant schoolboy might have done. A few
lights still twinkled into the October air, some from behind
shutters, others through the open glass. André
paused to survey the majestic front of the palace as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
faces the broad terrace that commands the gardens,
that terrace where to-day the bare-legged French children
scamper and the chattering tourists stroll—those
gardens where, could he have known it, was to be
played out the tragi-comedy of <i>The Diamond Necklace</i>
and the downfall of the descendants of Le Roi Soleil.
And he was asking himself, would he ever see Versailles
again?</p>

<p>Up there to the right was the window of Denise’s
room. If only he could have said two words of farewell
before he rode out to battle with the unknown! Hush!
the shutters were being fretfully thrown back. Yes,
that figure in white was Denise looking out, as so many
in their sorrow or passion have looked out, to the passionless
stars for an answer, and in vain. His blood
throbbed feverishly, until Denise, ignorant that in the
darkness below her a heart as cruelly torn as her own
was beating wistfully, wearily closed the shutters, and
went back to a sleepless bed.</p>

<p>André stole away across the gardens to seek the road
yonder where a trusted servant from Paris would be
waiting with his best horse.</p>

<p>“She is not a peasant,” he muttered, showing
whither his thoughts were travelling. “Well, well!”</p>

<p>“If I am not at the palace by nine o’clock, Jean,” he
said as he mounted, “come for my orders to the inn
called ‘The Cock with the Spurs of Gold.’” And
Jean nodded knowingly.</p>

<p>Orders! André smiled grimly. Dead men can give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
no orders, not even for their own burial, nor can they
take all their secrets with them; more was the pity.</p>

<p>When the servant had disappeared André bound the
mare’s hoofs with felt, and she whinnied affectionately,
as if she understood. She had only twice been so
treated, once the night before Fontenoy and now, for
she was the English blood mare which had crushed
into pulp the face of that miserable dead woman in the
charcoal-burner’s wood and had saved her master’s life
from “No. 101” and George Onslow. André stroked
her neck and whispered into her ear. To-night she
might have to save his honour as well as his life.</p>

<p>Once in the main road André drew rein in the
shadow of a tree on the outskirts of the forest and listened
attentively. To the right ran the track for farm
carts that led directly to the inn, but he decided not to
take that. If by any chance he had been followed or
an ambush was laid his foes would certainly choose
that track, his natural route. He therefore rode past
it, again halted to listen, and then plunged fearlessly
under the trees, picking his way along a wood-cutter’s
disused path.</p>

<p>Already, through the tangle of boughs, he could
make out the blurred shape of the inn ahead, when a
faint hiss brought his sword from the scabbard. No,
that was a low whistle there on the right. That bush,
too, just in front was stirring suspiciously; by St.
Denys! the crown of a man’s hat? A howl of surprise
and pain rent the air. André had driven in his spurs;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the maddened mare had leaped on to the bush and the
hat with the man’s head under it was cut through with
one pitiless stroke of the sword. In went the spurs
again; for he saw now there were three others running
up from the main track which he had refused to follow.
The flash of a pistol: the bullet went through his cloak,
but the man who fired it took André’s sword point in
his throat and dropped, gurgling. The remaining two
stood their ground, and struck at him with their
swords. One of them, with a cry “Seigneur Jésu!”
lurched forward, run through the breast. But the other
had stabbed the mare from behind. She plunged and
fell heavily. André felt a sharp pain in his left arm;
he, too, was stabbed! He had a vision of himself being
tossed through the air, his head struck a tree trunk,
and——</p>

<p>When he recovered consciousness he was lying on
the ground and all was still. In an agony of bewildered
fear he tore his coat open and felt for the despatch.
Impossible! Yes, it was still there. A red
mist danced in his eyes, his left arm throbbed with
pain, but he lay half sobbing with a delirious joy.
The despatch was still there! Death and dishonour
had not the mastery of him yet.</p>

<p>“You are hurt, Monseigneur?”</p>

<p>Yvonne, in her tattered gown and dishevelled hair,
with a lantern in her hand, was kneeling beside him.
André staggered to his feet; he scarcely knew whether
he was hurt or not. He gazed round, trying to recollect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
as the flickering light showed him four men’s bodies
lying this way and that near him. Dead, all of them.
And his horse—no, that was alive; she whinnied as he
tottered up to her.</p>

<p>“Take it to the stable,” he muttered, “take the
mare, Yvonne. It is not the first time she has saved
my life.”</p>

<p>Yvonne in silence led the bleeding beast away. The
girl who loved a cow could also understand why a soldier
could love his horse.</p>

<p>André now seized the lantern and examined the dead
men. Ha! two of them he did not know, but two were
the spies of “The Gallows and the Three Crows,” the
servants of the Duke de Pontchartrain and the Comte
de Mont Rouge. He sat down on a fallen tree trunk,
faint and sick. But the shock braced his dazed mind
and he tugged out his watch. Ten minutes to twelve.
Ten minutes! He could still be in time. His arm indeed
was dripping with blood, but it was a mere flesh-wound,
which he promptly bound up with his handkerchief,
and by this time Yvonne had returned.</p>

<p>“Tell me what happened,” he commanded.</p>

<p>“I was sitting in the kitchen,” she said quietly,
“when I heard a cry—a terrible cry. I seized a bludgeon
and a lantern and rushed out. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Monseigneur,
it was horrible; you were fighting and falling.
I struck as hard as I could, and then all was still.
Monseigneur, I can see now, killed three of them, but
the fourth I think I killed. See—there!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe37_5" id="i_268">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_268.jpg" alt="Yvonne, with a finger to her lips, holding her petticoats off the floor, stole in,

<p class="caption">Yvonne, with a finger to her lips, holding her petticoats off the floor, stole in,
and behind her a stranger.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Her bludgeon was lying beside one of the dead men,
whose head it had battered in. Yvonne began to cry at
the sight.</p>

<p>“Will they hang me, Monseigneur?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Hang you! Good heavens! You have saved my
life, my honour. They will not hang you unless they
hang me, and they will not do that. Come, Yvonne,
we must show these <i>canaille</i> where the superintendent
of the police can see them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>They carried the four bodies to one of the outhouses,
and not till then did André enter the inn parlour to
wait for the agent of the Jacobites; but no agent arrived,
and, after drinking some wine which Yvonne found for
him and telling her to summon him if required, André
dismissed her, drew a chair up to the fire, and began
to ponder on the night’s work; but his mind refused to
think. A curious numbness as if produced by a drug
steadily overpowered him, and after wrestling with
himself in vain he fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>He had been lying in the chair perhaps a quarter of
an hour when the door softly opened. Yvonne with a
finger to her lips, holding her petticoats off the floor,
stole in, and behind her a stranger, shading the light
he carried with his hand, stepped stealthily on tiptoe.</p>

<p>In silence they both inspected the sleeping André.
Then Yvonne very cautiously inserted her hand inside
the sleeper’s coat and probed as it were gently. The
pair inspected the despatch closely, smiling when they
observed the handwriting on the cover. Then with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
the same practised sureness of touch, they rebuttoned
the coat, and withdrew as noiselessly as they had entered;
but as they reached the threshold a little tongue
of flame from one of the logs on the fire suddenly revealed
the face of Yvonne’s companion to be that of
the Chevalier de St. Amant.</p>

<p>Outside the door, the girl hung her lantern quietly
on the wall in the passage.</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t François come?” she asked, in an
anxious whisper.</p>

<p>“François will never come,” the Chevalier replied,
very curtly.</p>

<p>“Do you”—she pushed back her matted hair with
a gesture of horror—“do you——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. The English have been on François’s
track for some time. He was last seen, I learn, loitering
about the Carrefour de St. Antoine. Poor fool,
why did he go there, of all places? He has disappeared
and——”</p>

<p>“George Onslow?” she interrupted with a flash of
anger.</p>

<p>“I fear so. Onslow is mad with despair and wrath.
He had discovered François’s trade and his Jacobite
employers; and the English Government pays handsomely
for Jacobite secrets. Onslow, too, was convinced
he would get no more papers as he had got
them before, and so——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.” Then she added, “And he desired revenge
on a woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>The Chevalier nodded quietly. “If he had secured
from François that paper which De Nérac is carrying,
revenge was in his hands. But the madman has struck
too soon; it is just as well for all of us.” He looked
up and down the dimly lit passage. “Some day,” he
said, in a matter-of-fact tone that was cruelly tragic,
“François’s fate will be mine.”</p>

<p>The girl flung out a hand of passionate protest. Her
voice choked.</p>

<p>“I feel it for certain,” the Chevalier continued, “it
is fate, the fate of our—” He checked himself
sharply. “Oh, I shall not resent my turn when it
comes; I have no desire to live now.”</p>

<p>“No.” She, too, stretched arms of impotent appeal
against the grip of a pitiless destiny. “No, there is
nothing to live for, now.”</p>

<p>The Chevalier looked into her eyes with the earnest
scrutiny of deep affection. “So your question, too, has
been answered?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Only as I expected. Could it be otherwise?”</p>

<p>“All for De Nérac,” he commented aloud to himself;
“all for De Nérac—love, success, glory, honour, and,
as if that were not enough, he and that wanton will
frustrate the revenge and punishment——”</p>

<p>“Yes, he will do that. It is the destiny of France.”</p>

<p>The thought imposed silence on both. André’s
measured breathing could be heard dying away in
peaceful innocence in the dim passage.</p>

<p>“But this attack?” Yvonne demanded suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“The ministers and the Court, of course,” was the
quick reply. “Some one has warned them of <i>his</i>”—he
nodded towards the parlour—“his errand. The
some one can only be Onslow, the miserable traitor,
and it explains François’s disappearance, too. The
despatch can wait. But Onslow’s game must be
watched or——”</p>

<p>“And checkmated,” she interrupted decisively.
“Ah! I see it now—I see it all now.”</p>

<p>They fell to talking earnestly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Three hours later André had returned to his room in
the palace as he had left it—by his rope ladder. He
had an interesting story to add to the morning chocolate
of Madame de Pompadour, and he was able to give
back intact a despatch which he had been unable to
deliver.</p>

<p>And the next event was at ten o’clock, when the
Duke of Pontchartrain was chatting with the morning
crowd in the Œil de Bœuf. Sharp exclamations, followed
by a dead silence, greeted the entry of the Captain
of the Queen’s Guards, whose left arm, all could
see, was bandaged and carried in a sling.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Duc,” André said in a voice that rang
through the room, “His Majesty commands your presence
at eleven o’clock in the Council Chamber.” He
paused to allow the royal message to be appreciated by
the attentive company; then he added: “And, Monsieur
le Duc, I beg to say for myself that if your Grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
wishes to know where your servant and that of the
Comte de Mont Rouge are, who attempted to murder
me last night when carrying out the commission of the
King of France, your Grace will find them both dead,
along with two others, in the inn called ‘The Cock
with the Spurs of Gold.’”</p>

<p>A haughty bow, and he had left the astonished
Duke and the appalled audience to their bewildered
reflections.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE KING FAINTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> customary midday service in the chapel at the
palace that morning was unusually crowded. Mansart’s
dignified and classical architecture in all its frigid
splendour is best viewed to-day by the visitor from the
royal tribune, and it is with difficulty that the cold and
empty desolation condescends to conjure up for the imagination
the historic share of this chapel in the grand
age of the French monarchy. For under Louis XV.—sensualist
and bigot—the homage of attendance at the
rites of the religion of the Sovereign and the national
Church was as profitable, nay, as obligatory, as obedience
to the inflexible conventions of Court etiquette
and the good breeding of the Faubourg St. Germain.
So, indeed, it had been under Louis XIV. and the
ascetic pietism of Madame de Maintenon; so it continued
to be under Louis XV. and the genial culture of
Madame de Pompadour and the libertinism of Madame
du Barry. But, André, like every one else in the congregation
that morning, was not thinking of this curious
paradox as his eye scanned the <i>dévots</i> worshipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
beside the men and women who patronised Voltaire and
laughed at miracles in polished epigrams that dissolved
the central truths of the Christian faith into a riddle for
the vulgar. He saw the King, the Queen, and the crowd
of courtiers, he saw Madame de Pompadour, who as yet
had not gained, as she did later, the seat she coveted
in the grand tribune. He was asking himself, as he
mechanically rose from or fell on his knees, where was
the Duke of Pontchartrain and what had the King
said to him?</p>

<p>André, alike with the foes of his own order, knew
that a crisis had been reached. The next forty-eight
hours must settle decisively the great battle between
the Court and the <i>maîtresse en titre</i>. And the decision
rested with the royal figure kneeling devoutly on his
crimson faldstool, with that man of the soft, impenetrable,
bored eyes, who broke all the Ten Commandments,
yet said his prayers with the same absorption as
the most fanatical <i>dévot</i>. Yes; Louis’s worship was
watched with feverish interest by every man and
woman present.</p>

<p>“He is in a great rage,” the Comtesse des Forges
whispered, as she crossed herself; “he never says all
the responses unless he is truly angry.”</p>

<p>The Abbé de St. Victor tittered gently, rather because
the licentious love story he had had stitched into
his service-book had reached an amusing <i>dénoûement</i>.
“To be sure,” he whispered back behind his lace handkerchief,
“and he never is so polite to the Queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
as when he is hopelessly in love with another
woman.”</p>

<p>“Poor Pontchartrain,” whispered the Duchess, “always
kisses me with passion half an hour before he
kisses Françoise. All well-bred men are like the King
in that, I suppose. It is the kiss of peace,” she pouted
at the High Altar.</p>

<p>The Abbé tittered again with dulcet decorum, but,
seeing Denise’s eye on him, prayed for the rest of the
service with exemplary fervency and finished his love
story at the same time.</p>

<p>When the congregation broke up, the Queen’s antechamber
was the general meeting-place of the noble
rebels, and Denise, lingering without, marked with
surprise Madame de Pompadour’s sedan chair stop in
the gallery. Madame de Pompadour had her chair
just because it was the privilege of mesdames of
the blood-royal, but to return this way was a fresh
outrage.</p>

<p>Denise was still more surprised when she was addressed.</p>

<p>“I beg you,” said the lady, “to present my humble
duties to her Majesty and to pray her to do me the
honour of accepting these flowers.” She tendered a
magnificent bouquet.</p>

<p>Denise looked her up and down. “The gentleman-usher
of the week, Madame,” she replied, making
a motion with her fan, “conveys messages to her
Majesty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“I am aware of that,” Madame de Pompadour said
sweetly, “but I asked a favour, Mademoiselle; may I
simply add that I hope if the Marquise de Beau Séjour
should so far forget herself as ever to ask a favour of
the Marquise de Pompadour she will not be so foolish
or so uncharitable as to refer it to her gentleman-usher.”</p>

<p>The two women confronted each other in silence.
Then Madame de Pompadour curtsied deferentially,
stepped into her chair, and disappeared. Denise walked
into the antechamber with two angry red spots in her
pale cheeks and her grey eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” cried the Comtesse des Forges. “It
is insufferable. What insolence! My consolations,
dear Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“There is something coming,” the Abbé de St.
Victor said gravely. “The grisette’s speech was a
trumpet of war. Before long there will be a new maid
of honour—that’s what she——”</p>

<p>“A hundred l-livres to one,” stammered Des Forges,
“that it is n-not this week.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take that,” said the Abbé, using the jewelled
pencil the Duchess had given him. “I want a hundred
livres sorely.”</p>

<p>“Here is the Duchess,” exclaimed Mademoiselle
Claire.</p>

<p>“Well? the news—the news?” cried a dozen excited
voices.</p>

<p>“Terrible,” said the Duchess, fanning herself languidly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
“terrible. Pontchartrain is ordered to his estates;
he is forbidden Paris and Versailles.”</p>

<p>“For how long?”</p>

<p>“For ever—for ever. No time was said. The King
was dreadfully angry. He swore by St. Louis and refused
to believe all Pontchartrain’s falsehoods. Oh,
my friends, think of living always in the country,
the horrible country, where there are so many rosy-cheeked
wenches that milk cows. Pontchartrain
will take to drinking milk for breakfast, I am
sure, before I am dressed, and Françoise will never
consent to live in our château, and I sha’n’t have
any one worth a sou to wash my lace and do my
hair. Ah! the King is abominably cruel and inconsiderate.”</p>

<p>While the ladies were bewailing her fate, St. Benôit
turned to the Abbé. “How could the Duke be such
a fool,” he asked savagely, “as to allow André to be
attacked—André of all men?”</p>

<p>“The information was explicit,” the Abbé said, in
a low voice. “If the attack had succeeded, we should
have ruined the grisette.”</p>

<p>St. Benôit made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“The folly,” added the Abbé, “lay in employing fellows
who could be recognised.”</p>

<p>“With the result,” growled St. Benôit, “that the
country will enjoy the ablest head in our party. It’s
simply disgusting.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” commented the Chevalier drily. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
sympathise with the Duke. Only I haven’t a château
to retire to, worse luck.”</p>

<p>The remark had been heard by the ladies, and called
out a dozen questions.</p>

<p>“Yes, Duchess,” the Chevalier said quietly, “this
afternoon I have my last audience with His Majesty.
I understand I am to be dismissed—from Versailles,
perhaps from France.”</p>

<p>“But who will take your place?” cried Mademoiselle
Claire.</p>

<p>“The lady who will shortly take all our places,
Madame la Marquise de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>He glanced at Denise, and the glance went home.
She had refused to let him ruin Madame de Pompadour
and André with her; he had obeyed because he
loved her; and he alone, poor boy, was to pay the penalty.
In Denise’s soul, stricken by remorse, surged the
wild desire that had been shaping for days. If only by
some great act of renunciation, of self-sacrifice, she
could repair the terrible harm that her love for André
had done to her and their cause.</p>

<p>“We are ruined, beaten,” the Comtesse des Forges
said in a hopeless tone. “That woman has won.
Fate is against us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, nothing but a miracle can save us now,” St.
Benôit remarked.</p>

<p>“And even the Abbé will admit that the age of
miracles is past.”</p>

<p>“You forget, <i>mon cher</i>. The grisette is herself a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
miracle—of Satan,” retorted the Abbé, but the company
was in no mood for jests. The completeness of
Madame de Pompadour’s triumph was too convincing
and too galling. And the Duke’s dismissal they knew
well would be followed shortly by other blows as cruel,
as well directed, and as insulting. The King was in
the hands of an able and unscrupulous woman with an
abler hero as her ally, and the King was absolute master
of France.</p>

<p>“If only His Majesty would fall ill,” murmured the
Duchess, “if only he would fall dangerously ill.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” the Comtesse cried, with a splendidly vindictive
gleam under her heavy eyelids, “ah, then we
could treat that wanton as we treated the Duchess of
Châteauroux.”</p>

<p>The company assented in silence. Well did they all
remember the memorable events of Metz in 1743, when
Louis the Well-Beloved had been smitten down, and
the Church and the Court had so skilfully used his
fears of death to get the <i>maîtresse en titre</i>, the Duchess
of Châteauroux, dismissed.</p>

<p>“And the Duchess died, the miserable sinner,” said
Mademoiselle Claire, “very soon. It surely was the
judgment of Heaven.”</p>

<p>“The same miracle,” smiled the Abbé, “never happens
twice, alas!”</p>

<p>“And the King was never so well as to-day,” added
St. Benôit, remorsefully.</p>

<p>Denise had already withdrawn. Deep as was her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
resentment against Madame de Pompadour, strong as
was her desire by self-sacrifice, if need be, to atone for
what she now felt was a sin, the conversation of her
friends never failed to offend her tastes and her conscience.
She was working for a cause, they were simply
bent on vengeance.</p>

<p>The Chevalier met her in the gallery as he thoughtfully
strolled away.</p>

<p>“Courage, Mademoiselle,” he stopped to say. “I
cannot win your love; perhaps I may yet be permitted
to help to make you happy,” and he glided off before
she could ask what he meant or speak a word of all the
things she longed to say.</p>

<p>The young man had guessed aright. That afternoon
Louis dismissed him in royally curt words, intimating
at the same time that he desired to see him no more at
Versailles or Paris. The Chevalier simply bowed, and
the King now sat alone in his private <i>Cabinet de Travail</i>
busy with his secret correspondence and somewhat
troubled in mind. Madame de Pompadour had had her
way, but the Chevalier de St. Amant, Louis was aware,
left his service with a dangerous store of knowledge.
And Louis was in fact penning a secret order to the
police for his immediate arrest and detention in the
fortress of Vincennes when the rings of the curtain
over the door behind him rasped sharply. Some one
had unceremoniously entered.</p>

<p>The King turned angrily at this extraordinary
defiance of his express command that he was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
disturbed by no one. One glance, and the pen dropped
from his hand.</p>

<p>“You recognise me, Sire?” said the intruder slowly.</p>

<p>“Dead—dead,” the King muttered. His fingers
had clenched, his face was ashy grey.</p>

<p>“I was dead, but I have come back as I promised.
The dead do not forget.”</p>

<p>Louis stared straight at him as a man stares in fear
through the dark. Two great drops of perspiration
dripped on to the unsigned <i>lettre de cachet</i>.</p>

<p>“Some day, perhaps soon,” said the man, “your
Majesty will answer for your acts, not at the tribunal
of men, but at the tribunal of—the devil.”</p>

<p>Louis crouched in his chair. His lips moved, but
he could not speak.</p>

<p>“Fifteen years ago we last met, your Majesty and I.
My wife was stolen from me, my nobility branded,
myself condemned and executed on a false charge, and
you, Sire, were the author of all these foul deeds. To-day
your Majesty is betrayed by the unknown. The
man who steals, and will continue to steal, your papers,
Sire, is not ‘No. 101’; it is I—I—” he stepped forward—“I,
the dead.”</p>

<p>Louis shrank back, his dry lips moving; his fingers
convulsively crept towards the hand-bell.</p>

<p>“Touch that bell,” said the man in a terrible tone,
“and I will strangle you, Sire—royal betrayer of women,
curse of the orphan and the fatherless.”</p>

<p>Louis’s arm fell paralysed at his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Take warning,” the unknown continued, “take
warning in time. If you, Sire, would save yourself
from the judgment of God, dismiss at once the woman
who betrays you, the woman called the Marquise de
Pompadour.” He paused and repeated her name
twice, adding with emphasis on each word, “And remember
<i>Dieu Le Vengeur! Dieu Le Vengeur!</i>”</p>

<p>The motto seemed to strike an awful chord in the
King’s memory. He covered his face with his hands.
When at last a long silence gave him courage again to
look up, the room was empty. He was alone!</p>

<p>Ah! He had dreamed an evil dream, that was all.
With a shudder of relief he stretched his arms as one
freed from the mastery of unendurable pain. A dream,
thank God! an evil dream. And then his eye fell on
his desk. The <i>lettre de cachet</i> was torn into bits, and
the bits were wet with the perspiration of his agony.
The King tottered to his feet, clutched at the hand-bell
feverishly, and rang—rang—rang.</p>

<p>The gentleman-usher stared in awe at His Majesty’s
ashy grey face and twitching lips.</p>

<p>“Did—did any one pass out?” Louis stammered.</p>

<p>“Sire?”</p>

<p>“Did any one pass out, out from here?” Louis repeated.</p>

<p>“No, Sire.” The man’s face was both puzzled and
frightened. His royal master put his hand on a chair
to support himself.</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“I heard voices in the room, Sire, but——”</p>

<p>“You heard voices, ah!”</p>

<p>“But I can swear no one either entered or left since
your Majesty gave orders for—ah! <i>Au secours!</i> <i>Hola</i>
there! <i>hola! au secours!</i>” the gentleman-usher’s voice
had become a shriek. “<i>Au secours! Le Roi, le Roi!</i>”</p>

<p>Louis had fallen in a dead faint on the floor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>A WISHED-FOR MIRACLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wished-for miracle had happened after all. Yet
the news that the King had suddenly fainted, which
spread like wildfire through the palace, was at first
made light of. “The King,” said the Abbé de St.
Victor, “likes to show a touch of human and feminine
weakness; he faints as women do, to relieve the ennui
of perpetual flattery.” In two or three hours, however,
it was known that after being put to bed His
Majesty had fainted again and again, that he had
scarcely rallied, that the doctors whispered of palsy
and a stroke, and that his condition was truly critical.
The excitement slowly rose to feverish anxiety, mingled
with no little exultation. Versailles was thrilled
as Paris and France had been thrilled in 1743, when
the King’s dangerous illness at Metz had fired every
class into touching demonstrations of passionate loyalty.
About midnight the watchers could relate that
urgent couriers had been despatched, on what errands
no one could precisely say, but it was certain that Monsieur
le Dauphin, absent on a hunting expedition, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
been summoned to return at once, that mesdames the
princesses were being fetched from their convent, that
a council of ministers would be held as soon as the
Dauphin arrived, that the Archbishop of Paris and the
saintly Bishop of Bordeaux, then in the capital, had
been invited by the King’s confessor to come to Versailles.
Towards dawn the doctors reported that His
Majesty had been twice bled, that he had rallied for an
hour and then slowly slipped back into virtual unconsciousness.
Unless—unless, the whispers ran, a change
for the better came soon, France would have a new king.</p>

<p>And Madame de Pompadour? Her name was on
every one’s lips. A new king! Would it be the Bastille
or Vincennes for the grisette then? Fierce joy
throbbed in the Queen’s apartments when the rumour
was confirmed that Madame de Pompadour, on hearing
of her royal lover’s illness, had at once hurried to his
room, but that the door had been shut in her face, by
whose orders no one knew, nor whether it was with the
King’s consent or not. What was certain was that the
King’s confessor had refused to prepare his Sovereign
for absolution so long as he remained in mortal sin, and
that the Archbishop of Paris and the Bishop of Bordeaux
would without doubt presently support the confessor.
The dramatic scene at Metz was in fact repeating itself
at Versailles. The King must be reconciled to his
Queen and wife, must confess his sin, and promise to
dismiss the partner in his guilt from his Court and his
presence before he could receive the most solemn ministrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
of the Church. And when Queen Marie
Leczinska’s ladies were aware that their royal mistress
had on her own initiative gone to her husband’s sick
couch, had been admitted, and had not yet returned, a
sigh of thankfulness, exultation, and vengeance went
up. The hours of Madame de Pompadour’s supremacy
were numbered. A just Heaven had intervened.
Madame de Pompadour was doomed.</p>

<p>By nine o’clock next morning the <i>noblesse</i> had flocked,
or were still flocking, in crowds from Paris to Versailles,
thirsting for news, pining for revenge, on the
tiptoe of excitement. The court-yards and stables
were blocked with their carriages and every minute
brought fresh arrivals. The Œil de Bœuf was filled
with officers, nobles, clerics, officials, who overflowed
into the Galerie des Glaces, in the noble windows of
which chattered groups of eager questioners. In the
Œil de Bœuf itself the subdued babble of talk rose and
fell, but all eyes were alertly watching the white and
gold doors so jealously kept by the Swiss Guards. Beyond
was the royal bed-chamber, but what was passing
within who could say? The physicians had forbidden
the <i>entrée</i> to every one save the King’s valet, a couple
of menial servants, the royal confessor, and now the
Bishop of Bordeaux. How critical affairs were reckoned
to have become could be judged by the presence
of the Chevalier de St. Amant, the Duke of Pontchartrain,
and the Comte de Mont Rouge, who had dared
thus to defy the exile imposed by the sick King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“I t-tell you,” Des Forges was saying, “he s-saw a
d-devil and f-fainted. I d-don’t w-wonder.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a devil nor the devil; it was a woman,”
the Abbé corrected. “Some women are devils, but all
devils are not women. That is logic and truth together,
which is rare.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a woman,” Mont Rouge added. “A
woman in the shape of a vampire.”</p>

<p>“It was only a flower girl,” Pontchartrain laughed,
and he threw in a ribald story which set his hearers
choking with laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, when he was bled the blood came out
black——”</p>

<p>“No, no; purple”—“yellow”—“blue”—corrected
half a dozen voices, and each had a witness who had
seen the bleeding and could swear to the colour; and
so the speculation as to the causes of the King’s illness
gaily ran on. The most extraordinary theories were
afloat, for that the King had “seen something” was
now a matter of common knowledge. But all were
agreed on one point—Madame de Pompadour’s fate
was sealed. Whether the King recovered or whether
the Dauphin succeeded him the grisette was ruined.</p>

<p>André had hurried from the Queen’s antechamber
to learn what could be learned. A glimpse of Denise’s
proud, pale face had been granted him as his spurs rang
along the galleries. He had read in it pity wrestling
with joy, and his soul was bitter within him. And
the cold glances, the silence of his friends if he drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
near, the shrugs of the shoulders, completed the tale.
He, too, was ruined if the Court could have its way.
His foes, though they had not published their evidence
yet, could prove that he was the ally of Madame de
Pompadour. His success inspired their jealousy, his
ability their fear. They had tried to murder him in
order to procure the final damning proof, and they had
failed. But he could never be forgiven for the humiliation
of the Duke of Pontchartrain, and Mont Rouge’s
arm, not yet healed, cried out for vengeance. To-morrow
it would be his turn for exile to Nérac,
stripped of his honours, happy if permitted to eat his
heart out in a debt-loaded château far from Paris and
Versailles. André had played for a great stake; he
had been within an ace of winning and now he had
lost. Yet alone, shunned, neglected in this seething
crowd, he found himself despising as he had never despised
before the <i>noblesse</i> to which he belonged. The
Court of a dying king does not show even an ancient
and haughty nobility, justly proud of its manners and
its refinement, at its best. Of the hundreds here were
there any who felt any pity, any real affection, for the
Sovereign over whose vices they were jesting, at whose
weaknesses they jibed? Ambition, curiosity, greed,
avarice, jealousy, could be read in many faces; the
<i>noblesse</i> were here to worship and honour the rising
sun, to flatter the Dauphin, to intrigue, to traffic at the
foot of a new throne in the squalid and sleepless scuffle
for places, pensions, ribbons, honours, power. André<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
turned away and gazed out of the window, at the serenely
noble gardens where the autumn sun was shining
on the autumn trees, on the dewy grass, and gleaming
statues. Yes, the peace of Nérac near the Loire would
be welcome though bought by failure in this Court of
Versailles. But there remained “No. 101,” and the
fascination of that unsolved riddle gripped him to-day
more mercilessly than ever before. The key to the
mystery was so near. Was he, too, like all the others,
to be baffled? And then there was Denise. He could
have had her love; never could he forget that supreme
moment when they had stood hand in hand, and life
had given him all that a man’s soul could dream or desire;
but he had lost Denise. Had he? Ah, had he?
And as he stared out towards the Fountain of Neptune
the gardens melted into a dark and secret staircase, and
once again he heard the beating of the heart of the
Pompadour. The vision filled him with a great pity.
She was no worse than he had been. There were women
in this Court—did he of all men not know it?—on
whose carriages glowed coronets and haughty coats
of arms, with as little right to absolution as Madame de
Pompadour and the dying King. But they confessed
and were absolved. Confession and absolution! The
mummery of priests. She at least had sinned from
ambition, because the flesh and the spirit would not
permit her to remain Antoinette de Poisson. But she
was a <i>bourgeoise</i> and they were noble. For all that,
could those noble women or these men ever understand—would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
the world ever understand before it judged the
heart of such a woman as the Pompadour? To him,
perhaps, alone some of the inscrutable riddles of the
spirit had been revealed because his heart, too, beat as
hers did, and assuredly to that hated and feared woman
to-day the bitterness of death would be sweet and welcome
compared with the bitterness—the tragic bitterness—of
failure. God alone—if there was a God—could
know all and judge aright. For her and for
him, in this hour of defeat, a great pity was surely
fittest.</p>

<p>No one came to speak to him. The renegade Vicomte
de Nérac, alone there in the window, scarcely moved
even compassion. He had deserted his order; he deserved
punishment—to be an example to traitors who
betrayed their blood and their dignity—and the punishment
had begun. No one? Yes, one; the Chevalier
de St. Amant. André was surprised—touched.</p>

<p>“Pardon my presumption,” the young man said,
“but you and I, Vicomte, have more than once crossed
swords. I at least have done my best to defeat you;
you have done yours to defeat me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” André admitted readily.</p>

<p>“And you have won.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” André smiled as he looked down the
crowded Galerie des Glaces and back at the empty
space where they stood.</p>

<p>“Yes, Vicomte, you are victor.” His tones trembled
with emotion. “Victor in the one prize that matters—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
woman’s heart. Do not you forget that. I at least
cannot.”</p>

<p>André looked into his eyes, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“Whether,” the Chevalier continued, “I go to Italy
or you go to Nérac is a little thing; but the other is a
great thing, and the result will always be what it is—always.
It has been a fair fight if fights for a woman’s
love can ever be fair. Will you give me the pleasure
of shaking hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” André answered, with much emotion. “And
if I am not sent to Nérac you shall not go to Italy.”</p>

<p>“We will see.” The Chevalier had resumed his
jesting tone, for they were both being jealously
watched. He nodded and slipped away. André,
muttering, “Always, always,” slipped away, too.
“Always.” Was Denise still to be won, or why had
a tear stood in the boy’s eye when he had spoken?</p>

<p>“Madame!” he cried, aghast, as he stepped into the
Marquise de Pompadour’s salon.</p>

<p>She was sitting in her <i>peignoir</i> in front of the fire,
her hair about her lovely shoulders, staring at the
smouldering logs. Trunks half-packed littered the
room. Papers torn up and drawers half-open met
the eye in every corner. And when she wearily turned
round at his exclamation her face was the face of a
woman sleepless, haggard, and worn—the face of one
quieted by fear, misery, and failure.</p>

<p>“Ruined, Vicomte,” she murmured hopelessly,
“ruined, and you, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Not yet,” he answered, with such poor courage as
he could summon.</p>

<p>She flung back her hair and pointed at him with
a bare arm. “Look in the glass, miserable fellow-gambler;
your eyes are as mine, hunted by despair and
defeat, and we are both right. My God, have I ever
passed such a night? And unless I am gone from this
palace in six hours—oh, they have warned me—I shall
sleep in a cell at Vincennes. Courage, pshaw! The King
alone could save me and I have lost him for ever.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>She waved the question on one side. “It is a plot,”
she cried passionately, “a plot of my enemies. They
tried to murder you and they failed. Now this—this
is their last device. They have poisoned the King, that
his sick body may fall into the hands of the priests,
who will torture his soul till they have frightened him
into dismissing me. What can one woman do against
the Church, whose bishops keep mistresses as the King
does? Nothing, nothing. I am ruined. I fly from
here that I may leave Versailles free. Do you save
yourself. I can protect you no longer. Give me up,
go back to the Court, trample on the unfortunate—it
is not too late for you. Even my wenches know that,
and dare to insult me.”</p>

<p>“No, Madame, I will not give you up.”</p>

<p>“Poor, mad fool!” But the sudden, radiant flush in
that haggard face would have inspired a man under
sentence of death to hope and joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“And I will save you yet, Marquise.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, fixedly. “Vicomte,” she
moaned, with an exceeding bitter cry, “save me.
Yes, save me, I implore you.”</p>

<p>Her helplessness and her misery, she, who twenty-four
hours ago had been the Queen of Love to the
Sovereign of France, did not appeal in vain.</p>

<p>“The King may recover,” he said, “do not fly yet.
If in twelve hours I do not return you will never see
me again. Then, but not till then, for God’s sake
save yourself, Madame.”</p>

<p>“You have a clue—know something?”</p>

<p>“Adieu.”</p>

<p>She strove to keep him, but he bowed himself resolutely
out, and he knew she had flung herself back into
that chair in front of the fire to watch her fortunes and
her ambitions flicker out with the dying flames in the
remorseless march of the hours.</p>

<p>This time he boldly left by the public entrance.</p>

<p>Twelve hours! Twelve hours! he had no clue, no
information. He had spoken from the infatuation of
sheer pity; alas! he had nothing but a fierce and meaningless
resolve.</p>

<p>“André,” called softly a voice he knew only too well.
Denise was standing in the empty gallery, and in her
eyes there was something of the hunted despair and
fear Madame de Pompadour had read in his. “André,
you have been to see her?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“She is ruined.” She paused. “And they will
ruin you too. Let me save you; I can.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, very quietly, “you cannot.” Denise
looked at him, trembling. “You can only save me if
I now at once go on my knees to my foes. To you I
would gladly do it, for I have wronged you, and I love
you, but to them, never! never!”</p>

<p>Her head bowed in appealing silence.</p>

<p>“The Marquise de Pompadour,” he drew himself up,
“the Marquise honoured me with her friendship when
she was powerful. Now that she is fallen and in misery
I will not be such a dastard as to save myself by
helping to ruin her. No, I will not!”</p>

<p>“You are mad,” she cried incoherently. But his
chivalry fired her heart.</p>

<p>“You must do as you think right, Denise,” he said
gently, “and so must I. It is cruel for me—how cruel—no,
I must not speak.” He broke off and returned
to the Œil de Bœuf.</p>

<p>The crowd was denser than ever. Monsieur le
Dauphin had just passed through the heated, suffocating
room and was now in the royal bed-chamber. Suddenly
the subdued babel of tongues ceased as if by
magic. The doors were opening. Dukes, ministers,
nobles, lackeys pushed and fought to get to the front.
The King was dead! Resolutely the Swiss Guards
stemmed the surging tide. Ha! the King’s physician.
Dead silence.</p>

<p>“Nobles of the realm, and gentlemen,” cried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
physician, “I am happy to say that the sacred person
of His Majesty is no longer in danger.” A dull roar
as of inarticulate wild beasts rose and fell. “With
God’s help the King of France will, we trust, be shortly
restored to perfect health.”</p>

<p>The doors were closed again. The Comte de Mont
Rouge wiped his brow.</p>

<p>“It is now or never,” he whispered savagely to the
Duke of Pontchartrain.</p>

<p>“Yes, now or never,” smiled the Duke, “for I prefer
the society of the ladies of Versailles and Paris to that
of the drabs and bigots of Pontchartrain.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE FALL OF THE DICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> excitement was rather increased than diminished
by the report of the King’s recovery. Indeed, throughout,
men’s and women’s thoughts were absorbed far
more feverishly with the fortunes of Madame de Pompadour
than with those of Louis himself. A palace
revolution was what was desired, vengeance on the
woman who had threatened to become dictator, a happy
return to the old order; and the King’s illness was only
important as the extraordinary miracle which would
accomplish what was so passionately prayed for. The
noble gentlemen and ladies spent the next hour in
agitating suspense. And when it was reported that
the King had rallied so marvellously as to be out of
bed, to eat and to talk, the high hopes sank. Another
miracle had supervened to undo the work of the
first.</p>

<p>“A fig for miracles,” said Pontchartrain. “Voltaire
and the philosophers are right; they are either stupid,
useless, or meaningless. We can get on so much better
without them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>The “saints” of the circle in the Queen’s antechamber
were inexpressibly shocked. And they
sighed at the inscrutable and irritating way in which
things in this world were ordered by Providence.</p>

<p>“Your theology, my dear Duke, savours of <i>bourgeois</i>
vulgarity and ignorance. Heaven will only help
those who help themselves. That woman must be
ruined before the King is well enough to become insane
again. If we can only drive her from the palace
to-day she will never return.”</p>

<p>“And,” Mont Rouge added significantly, “there is
a pleasant pit into which we can drive her. The fall
will break her charming neck.” He began to explain
very earnestly his scheme, which was listened to with
the most eager attention.</p>

<p>“We have her,” he wound up, triumphantly. “I
shall not spend the winter at Mont Rouge.”</p>

<p>The next news was very inspiriting. The King, on
the advice of his physicians, was to leave Versailles for
Rambouillet, where change of air and, presently, some
of his favourite hunting would completely restore his
health. He was to leave that afternoon, accompanied
only by his confessor, his physician, and half a dozen
servants.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” commented Pontchartrain, “how
bored he will be. I suppose they left out his wife because
there are limits to what husbands can endure.
You agree, <i>ma mignonne</i>?” He kissed his Duchess’s
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“Yes, because there are no limits, <i>mon cher</i>,” she retorted,
“to what wives must endure.”</p>

<p>“Ah, we shall make you a vulgar and ignorant philosopher
yet, <i>chère amie</i>. And, as His Majesty said to
the grisette, yours is an education which promises me
infinite amusement.”</p>

<p>But the best part of the new information had still to
come. Madame de Pompadour had tried again to see
the King, but His Majesty had listened to his confessor’s
warning and refused. The doctors, too, had forbidden
any such interviews. The King must on no
account be excited or annoyed. Physicians and priests
alike had their cue from the ministers; and the King,
subject all his life to fits of gloomy remorse and superstition,
was again ready, after his illness, to listen to
the solemn remonstrances from the Church on his evil
life. Nor did the Court know that the memory of the
apparition, which had been the cause of his collapse,
had played its part in strengthening his determination
to free himself of Madame de Pompadour.</p>

<p>“She, too, must leave Versailles,” St. Benôit urged.
“Mont Rouge has shown us how we can complete the
victory once we have driven her out. When the King
returns from Rambouillet he must find her fled and
then—” He and they all smiled. As soon as the
King could bear exciting news there would be exciting
news for him with a vengeance.</p>

<p>Denise had so far listened in silence. She now made
a suggestion. “Can we not frighten her away?” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
said. “If she could be persuaded her life is in danger,
once the King has left the palace, she will go of her own
accord. I am quite ready to see her and tell her so.”</p>

<p>For Denise was still haunted by the desire, through
some act of self-sacrifice,—and to visit Madame de
Pompadour would be a painful humiliation,—to atone
for what her conscience called treachery in the past to
the cause. And if only the Pompadour would leave,
André would be really free from her baleful influence
and even now might be saved against himself.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary, Mademoiselle,” the Chevalier
said. “I have just come from Madame’s salon.” The
company that had welcomed his noiseless entry waited
breathlessly. “I think I have convinced her she had
better leave Versailles this very afternoon.”</p>

<p>Denise joined heartily in the sigh of relief. But the
Chevalier’s next sentence was disquieting. “The
Vicomte de Nérac,” he said, “is now in audience with
the King.”</p>

<p>What did that mean? Had the King sent for him?
He was strong enough to see him? Had the doctors
permitted it? Were the ministers and the confessor to
be present? The Chevalier could not answer these
questions. But he could vouch for the fact, as the
Vicomte had himself told him half an hour ago of the
royal summons.</p>

<p>“More than ever the grisette must leave,” the Abbé
de St. Victor pronounced. “Else the Vicomte will be
her agent and effect a reconciliation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>Mont Rouge and the Duke de Pontchartrain were
holding an earnest conversation in whispers with the
Chevalier. What the Chevalier said clearly gave them
great satisfaction, and Mont Rouge studied with ill-concealed
joy a paper which looked like a plan that the
Chevalier had produced.</p>

<p>“The time has come for the dice,” Mont Rouge said
decisively. With the help of the Duke he cleared a
table and laid out on it four dice-boxes.</p>

<p>“The ladies will throw as well as the gentlemen?”
asked the Comtesse des Forges. She was looking
meaningly at Mont Rouge.</p>

<p>“It is hardly necessary,” the Duke said carelessly.
“But if one lady be good enough to take her chance
then all must. What do you say, ladies?”</p>

<p>“I am always unlucky,” remarked the Duchess, “so
I will take my chance.”</p>

<p>“And you, Marquise?” the Duke turned deferentially
to Denise. Mont Rouge took up one of the dice-boxes
and began to rattle it noisily. Had his courage
not been beyond reproach, a close observer might have
thought he was at that moment very nervous. The
Comtesse des Forges was yawning at her beautiful face
in the mirror.</p>

<p>Before Denise could reply, André was seen standing
on the threshold. A cold air seemed at once to blow
over the room. No one offered a word of greeting, and
the conversation proceeded just as if a lackey had entered.
The Chevalier, indeed, went so far as to bow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
haughtily and to leave the room with the air of a man
who found André’s presence an intolerable intrusion.
Denise alone marked how pale André was and how his
dark eyes burned. A choking sensation, as if her heart
had ceased to beat, mastered her.</p>

<p>“I am sure,” André said very slowly and distinctly,
“it will interest you ladies and gentlemen to know that
I have ceased to be Captain of the Queen’s Guards, by
His Majesty’s commands.” A rustle of skirts, a suppressed
exclamation, a snuff-box dropped, showed in
the dead silence the emotion this news had produced.
“I am ordered,” André continued, “to retire to Nérac
until His Majesty is pleased to change his mind. My
congratulations, ladies and gentlemen. You desired
and plotted my ruin. You have achieved it.”</p>

<p>The curtain dropped. “And you, Marquise?”
repeated the Duke, imperturbably, holding out a dice-box
to Denise as if nothing had interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p>Denise saw all the flushed faces, the joy, the banished
fears. Too late! Too late! She could not save
André. No, but perhaps she could still punish the
woman who had seduced and ruined the man she loved.</p>

<p>“Of course I will gladly take my chance,” she
answered, in a voice of reckless revolt.</p>

<p>André was pacing down the gallery. No one could
have taken him for a ruined man, for aught than a
proud officer in the Chevau-légers de la Garde, a Croix
de St. Louis, and a Cordon Bleu. Though he knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
that fate had at last smitten him down, the bitterest
thought in his mind was that in a few hours Madame
de Pompadour would be flying, too, from Versailles.
The twelve hours would run out; she would never see
him again.</p>

<p>“So it is Nérac after all?”</p>

<p>André started. The Chevalier was at his elbow.
“No,” he answered, “it will not be Nérac.”</p>

<p>“The best swordsman in France will, to be sure,
take a lot of killing,” the young man retorted lightly.</p>

<p>The flash in André’s eye showed with what true
sympathy the Chevalier had divined his meaning.</p>

<p>“Well, Vicomte, let us say adieu. We shall not
meet again in Versailles, nor elsewhere, I fancy.” Behind
the tone of raillery peeped out a strange, almost
tragic, gravity.</p>

<p>They shook hands in silence; had, in fact, separated
a few paces when the Chevalier added carelessly,
“There was a wench asking for you in the stables—Yvonne
or some such name—I couldn’t make out
what it was all about, but she seemed distressed at not
getting word with you. Pardon my mentioning such
a trifle.” He hurried away.</p>

<p>Yvonne! André halted dead. Yvonne! Name of
St. Denys, what did that mean? For a moment he
wavered as if he hoped against hope that Denise might
appear. Then his spurs rang out on the polished floor.
He was hurrying to the stables.</p>

<p>The Chevalier went back to the antechamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“Only two,” Mont Rouge was saying, as he entered
the room, “only two threw sixes, two ladies curiously
enough, the Comtesse des Forges and the Marquise de
Beau Séjour.”</p>

<p>“How stupid,” yawned the Comtesse. “Must we
throw again? Or, perhaps, Mademoiselle Denise will
kindly withdraw and leave me victor?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” protested Mont Rouge, “the cast of the
dice must be fairly played out; I insist.” And the
company unanimously agreed with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well.” The Comtesse shrugged her
shoulders. “Comte, you shall throw for me this time.”</p>

<p>Mont Rouge took up one of the dice-boxes which he
had been fingering for some minutes.</p>

<p>“And will the Marquise permit me to throw for
her,” inquired the Chevalier.</p>

<p>Denise assented with a nod. But the suggestion did
not seem to please the Comtesse. A gleam of vindictive
malevolence lingered under her heavy lids, but a
glance from Mont Rouge reassured her.</p>

<p>The Chevalier advanced and threw a four and a
three. Mont Rouge, the company standing round and
watching eagerly, threw carelessly enough a two and
a one.</p>

<p>“Bungler!” cried the Comtesse, “you have lost.”</p>

<p>“I did my best,” Mont Rouge answered, looking
into her eyes, and he added in a whisper, “my best
for you. You have lost, but I have won.”</p>

<p>The Comtesse put her hand warningly on her lips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Her gaze lingered on Denise, pale and calm, accepting
her victory as the inevitable will of fate. “My congratulations,
Mademoiselle,” she said in the silky
tones with which women preface the insult of a kiss to
their most-feared rival.</p>

<p>“I will accept them to-morrow,” Denise answered,
“when I have done my duty.”</p>

<p>While the company were chattering gaily the Chevalier
carelessly and unnoticed took up the dice, first the
four and the three he had thrown for Denise, and then
the two and the one thrown by Mont Rouge, which
were still lying on the table. As he put back the
two and the one into the box which belonged to Mont
Rouge he smiled. He had detected these two were
loaded, yet curiously enough he said nothing. Indeed,
the discovery seemed to give him positive pleasure, and
he rallied the Comtesse des Forges for a good half-hour,
till her husband stammered with rage and Mont Rouge
was sulky with jealousy.</p>

<p>Just as the company were breaking up a sweating
horse dashed into the stables of the palace. André
flung himself from the saddle. He had ridden from
“The Cock with the Spurs of Gold” at a break-neck
gallop and his spurs were red. He now hurried off to
Madame de Pompadour’s salon, bursting in from the
secret staircase.</p>

<p>Madame gave him one look. “Begone! quick,
hussy,” she cried to the maid who was packing. The
scared girl fled from the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“Well?” Madame held out her arms in awful
suspense.</p>

<p>“Is the secret despatch,” André panted, “still in
your keeping?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, what of it?”</p>

<p>He sat down and wiped his face. “Ah! thank
God!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Madame kneeled down beside him. “What is it?”
she asked, in a caressing voice, “does the King want
it?”</p>

<p>“The King has already left Versailles; he is now on
his way to Rambouillet.”</p>

<p>A cry of despair was wrung from her. “Then I am
indeed ruined,” she moaned. “You have come to tell
me so. Ah!” she sobbed, her head in her hands on
his knees.</p>

<p>“No,” he raised her up. “I have come to save you.”</p>

<p>She stared at him stupefied, incredulous.</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame. You must leave Versailles at once,
but you must go to Rambouillet.”</p>

<p>“You are mad or drunk.” She pushed him away
angrily.</p>

<p>“No-no.” He almost forced her into a seat and
began to talk rapidly and with intense conviction.
Madame listened at first sullenly, then gradually became
interested, then excited; the lights began to blaze
in her eyes, the colour rose in her cheeks. She interrupted
sharply with questions. When André had
finished she sat thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“By God! I will do it.” She had sprung to her
feet. She was once again the Queen of Love, unconquerable,
immortal. “I can do it and I will.”</p>

<p>“Leave the rest to me, Madame,” André said.</p>

<p>She put a hand to his shoulder. “And your reward?”
She was wooing him unconsciously, as she
wooed all men.</p>

<p>“I will ask for it when I have succeeded.”</p>

<p>“And you shall have it. I promise.”</p>

<p>An hour later the Palace heard with rapture that
Madame de Pompadour had fled to Paris, in such fear
for her life that she had not had time to take even her
jewels with her. Her household was to follow her as
soon as possible. In the Queen’s antechamber the joy
was inexpressible. A third miracle! a third miracle!
The grisette had vanished. Ah! If she returned now
to one of the King’s castles it would be to the Bastille,
not Versailles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE THIEF OF THE SECRET DESPATCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> had André discovered?</p>

<p>When he had reached the stables he could not find
Yvonne, but at “The Cock with the Spurs of Gold,”
whither he hurried, he was not disappointed. And
Yvonne had news to give him as thrilling as unexpected.
The English spy she had learned was coming
to the inn that very afternoon to meet a strange woman,
and the meeting was to be kept a solemn secret.
Yvonne had felt sure Monseigneur ought to know, and
had ventured as far as the Palace in search of him.
André’s heart leaped at the chance that fate, which had
buffeted him so sorely, had now by a miracle put in his
way. The spy could be no other than George Onslow,
with whom he had crossed swords in the wood the
night before Fontenoy; and the woman? Would she
be the flower girl of “The Gallows and the Three
Crows,” the crystal-gazer, the mysterious “princess,”
whose dancing had first stirred his blood in London,
the woman who had said she loved him? Or would it
be some other unfortunate, caught like himself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
terrible toils of a mystery which bid fair to be the ruin
of them all?</p>

<p>What did it matter? André was sure of one thing.
Could he but hear what passed at that meeting he
would be many steps nearer to the solution of the blood-stained
riddle of “No. 101.”</p>

<p>Perhaps he could yet save Madame de Pompadour,
yet win Denise, yet take vengeance on his foes. The
hand of destiny was in this. With “No. 101” his life
had as it were begun; at each stage he had been now
thwarted, now strangely aided, by the acts of the unknown
traitor; with “No. 101” it was clearly fated
to end. Despair, insatiable curiosity, the blind impetus
of forces he could not control, alike steeled him to make
the attempt.</p>

<p>Yvonne was easily persuaded; indeed, she had
already schemed for it, and with her help he lay
concealed in the room of meeting and awaited with
a beating pulse the arrival of the traitors. The spy
proved to be George Onslow, as he had guessed, and
André studied his able, sleuth-hound face, the dark
eyes of slumbering passion, and the sensual lips, with
the eery yet joyous shiver of one who feels that here
is an opponent with whom reckoning must be made
before life is over. The woman, however, was unknown
to him. She was certainly not the crystal-gazer.
Nothing more unlike the black hair and dark
eyebrows, the creamy skin, of that mysterious enchantress
could be imagined. For this was a lady who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
to-day we should say had stepped straight from a pastel
by Latour, or, as André thought, from the Salon de
Vénus at Versailles, a girl with the figure of Diana and
that indefinable carriage and air which only centuries
of high birth and the company of such can bestow.
Denise’s grey eyes and exquisite pose of head were not
more characteristic of the quality that the <i>noblesse</i> of
the <i>ancien régime</i> rightly claimed as their monopoly,
than were the blue eyes and innocent insolence of the
stranger. And yet André felt that in the most mysterious
and irritating way she reminded him of some
one. But of whom? Of whom? And then he almost
laughed out loud. Of Yvonne!</p>

<p>They both talked in English as English was talked
in London, without a trace of a foreign accent. Now if
one thing was certain Yvonne did not know a word of
English, for he had tried her by many pitfalls in the
past and she had simply showed boorish but natural
ignorance. Nor could it be the crystal-gazer, for he
remembered her English was not the English of the
salons. Once only did they drop into French, and
then André was more puzzled than ever. Onslow
spoke it extraordinarily well, yet his accent betrayed
him at once; the girl, however, revealed to a noble’s
sensitive ear the idiom and tone so much more difficult
to acquire than mere accent of the Faubourg St. Germain.
Had the Comtesse heard that sentence she
would have said it might have been spoken by the
Duchesse de Pontchartrain. Strange, but true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>Much of the conversation was quite unintelligible.
There was a reconciliation to begin with, and André
marvelled at the subtle way in which the woman
soothed the man’s anger, and then with enchanting
nuances of provocation, of look, of gesture, quietly reduced
him to helpless and adoring submission. And
George Onslow was not the only man in the room who
at the end of that half-hour felt as clay in her hands.
They talked, too, of incidents, of persons, of things
which to André were a closed book. But the main substance
was perfectly clear and deliriously enthralling to
the concealed hearer. That very night the secret despatch
in Madame de Pompadour’s handwriting, which
the Court had tried to win by murder, was to be stolen
from the escritoire in which it still reposed, and in
which the King’s sudden illness and the ignorance of
its existence by all save Madame herself and André had
permitted it to stay. Onslow apparently had wormed
out the fact of its existence; the woman now informed
him of its hiding-place, and together they planned for
its theft, that it might be used by the English Government
to blast and ruin the King, with whom that Government
was still at war. It would also ruin the
Jacobites, which was not less important in English
eyes. That it would ruin Madame de Pompadour
neither Onslow nor the woman seemed to consider nor
care about. Why should they? What were Madame
and the hatred of a court to the English or they to her?</p>

<p>But André also learned many other things that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
as interesting. It was George Onslow who had informed
the anti-Pompadour party of the errand which
had led to the attack on André himself. And André
gathered that it was with the help of some one at Versailles
whose name was not mentioned, for he was
always spoken of as “Lui,” that the theft was to be
executed. A double-edged business, in fact, this plot.
The stolen despatch would do the work of the English
Government, but it would also do the work of the
Court. When its contents were made public Madame
would be ruined automatically. Hence the connivance
of “Lui” and his friends in the scheme.</p>

<p>The completeness of their information, the cold-blooded
way in which they arranged to a nicety the
smallest detail, appalled André. They both knew exactly
where Madame was lodged, how to get there, and
how to escape, of every fact concerned with the King’s
illness and of Madame’s certain flight, on which the
success of the plot hung. Who exactly was to be the
thief he could not make out; that apparently had already
been arranged, but George Onslow was to be at
the palace, and he was then to make his way to this
inn, whence he and his accomplice were to vanish their
own way into the friendly slums of Paris, that would
shelter every crime committed against itself and France.</p>

<p>“And the Chevalier?” Onslow had asked.</p>

<p>The woman replied in a low voice: “Have as little
to do with the Chevalier as possible. He is not to be
trusted in this business. He is no friend of mine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
no friend of yours. But,” she paused, “he is far too
much a friend of De Nérac.”</p>

<p>At the mention of his own name André almost betrayed
his presence, because the warning drew from
Onslow a deep “Ah!” and a look of undying hatred,
jealousy, and fear. But what had thrilled him quite as
much as the look and speech itself was the suppressed
emotion in the speaker’s voice. He had only heard a
woman speak like that once in his life, when he and
Denise had parted at the foot of the Pompadour’s stairs
an hour or two ago and he had refused to let her save
him.</p>

<p>“Take care of De Nérac,” the woman added slowly,
“he ruined you once, and if he can he will ruin you
again. De Nérac is the only man who has beaten me.
Nor am I the only woman who has found that out to
her cost.”</p>

<p>Onslow thrust out his hand. “What does that
say?” he demanded with a curious mixture of bravado,
curiosity, and fear.</p>

<p>She studied the lines carefully. “Before long you
and he will meet,” she answered, “and only one will
survive: which,” she paused, “rests with God.”</p>

<p>André found his sword coming slowly out of its
sheath. Pah! Let the traitor wait. The woman was
right. Onslow must first do his night’s work, and
then—and then—ah!</p>

<p>Onslow, too, had said nothing, but his face was eloquent
of his resolve. She let him kiss her fingers, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
let them linger in his, and her look promised much
more of reward when the task had been successfully
accomplished. The spy left the room with the air
André might have done, the air of a man who was daring
all things, hoping all things, for a woman’s sake.
Bitter as André felt towards this cold-blooded traitress,
he wished so fair a woman had not looked at that sensual
sleuth-hound like that.</p>

<p>Once alone the girl stood thoughtfully gazing into
space, and presently with a shiver wiped her fingers.
André, lost in his thoughts, missed the refined scorn
with which she flung the handkerchief she had used on
to the burning logs, as if it was soiled. Then she sat
down in front of the fire, rested her chin on her hands,
and mused. A faint but long-drawn sigh floated up to
the blackened rafters. André started. Where was
he? Lying, surely, in the damp grass on the rim of
that grisly wood at Fontenoy, staring up at a window
in a charcoal-burner’s cabin, which had been stealthily
opened. For just such a sigh had greeted him on that
night, a sigh from a weary woman’s heart.</p>

<p>And with an exultant throb in his blood he felt that
at last he was in the presence of “No. 101.” The
riddle was solved at last.</p>

<p>The woman stretched her arms as if in pain,—the
gesture was strangely familiar,—rose with decision,
and glided from the room.</p>

<p>André waited a few minutes before he cautiously
made his escape. All his doubts were gone. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
suspicions of the Chevalier had been dispelled by the
traitorous pair; if Yvonne was an accomplice it mattered
not; he saw what must be done. One more great
stroke and the game which he had been fighting for so
long would be his. Yes. He would save Madame de
Pompadour, take vengeance on his foes, and win Denise.
Not least, the man who had saved an army of
France at Fontenoy would reveal the secret and destroy
the traitor who had baffled all and betrayed the
destinies of his race.</p>

<p>And it was with the scheme planned out to a nicety
that he burst into Madame de Pompadour’s salon.</p>

<p>The Watteau-like shepherdesses of the clock on the
mantelpiece in the salon of Madame de Pompadour
chimed out eleven tinkling strokes into the darkness—how
few of us who have stood to-day in that dismantled
room have succeeded in hearing even the
echoes of what those bare walls could tell of the true
history of France, the history that can never be unearthed
by the École des Chartes. Just as the chimes
died away André climbed noiselessly up the secret stair,
and crouched with drawn sword and pistol cocked behind
the curtain, a corner of which he pulled back far
enough to give a clear glimpse into the room. It was
the third time since Madame had fled that he had, thief-like,
lurked in that hiding-place, and, as before, all
was ghastly still. Two or three of Madame’s servants
had followed her flight; the rest, he was aware, had proclaimed
their allegiance to the Court. The powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
favourite who had dismissed a minister was ruined,
and none now more noisily swore to their hatred of her
than the men and women who had thronged her toilette
or taken her pay.</p>

<p>In the dim light André could make out the half-packed
trunks, the litter of disorder, so eloquent of
their owner’s disgrace. How were the mighty fallen.
Here indeed was a truer text for priest and preacher
than the sins of the woman who had not been the first
to grace these silent apartments, an accomplice in the
passions of a King of France. The air to-night was
thick with ghostly memories of other women, not less
fair and frail, to whose inheritance of soiled supremacy
the Marquise de Pompadour had succeeded. And
there, gleaming in a faint ray, shone the escritoire
which contained the despatch. To complete her mastery
of the master of France, Madame had written it
with her own hand—had, by doing so, her enemies
hoped, signed her own death-warrant. The King’s
secret. Little did André know, as he waited, that
the true story of Louis’s incredible and persistent determination
to pursue his own tortuous policy, to revel
in thwarting and intriguing against his own ministers—at
once a disease, a passion, and a pastime in that
enigma of kings—was in all its labyrinthine details reserved
to be the discovery of a noble a century hence,
and to be read in a Republican France, a France that
had done with kings, that made Versailles a public
picture gallery, a France that had seen the victorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
legions of Germany offer an imperial crown to the descendant
of the parvenu Prussian ally of Louis in the
Fontenoy campaign in yonder Galerie des Glaces of
the Roi Soleil.</p>

<p>André shivered. He was thinking only of “No.
101.” Could that girl of his own race, if ever woman
was, really be the traitor? And if she was, by what
temptation of the devil had she embarked on her awful
career? To-night she would be a prisoner; she was
doomed to die, but would they ever know her secret—the
real secret of “No. 101”? Punish her they could,
but the secret, the real secret, was beyond their power.
André clenched his hands. She would baffle them
after all. It was the secret that fascinated him, and
that was surely destined to perish with her in a felon’s
grave. “No. 101” would be like the man in the iron
mask—unknown and unknowable—a perpetual puzzle
to the generations to come. Torturing thought.</p>

<p>A mouse squeaked across the floor, the boards
creaked. André recalled with a curious thrill the
grisly warning that all who had ever seen the face of
“No. 101” had perished. He recalled the death of
Captain Statham, of others. Was he, after all, to share
the same fate? In this deathly quiet he felt his blood
go cold, his courage ooze and ebb. A longing to crawl
away began to master him.</p>

<p>Brave man though he was, he would have obeyed it,
when a rustle on the public stairs brought him with a
swift spring to his feet. For that was the rustle of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
woman’s skirt. The door was opening. The rustle
again, and a gleam of light from a lamp. A woman,
by God! the thief was a woman. <i>The</i> woman!</p>

<p>Yes. The girl at the inn surely, for this was a tall
young woman who walked straight forward to the
escritoire, a thief who knew no fear, calmly determined
to do her business without flinching. André wavered
as he had in the charcoal-burner’s cabin. Should he
arrest her there and then or wait? Yes, no? Yes,
wait. She must be caught red-handed in the act that
he might win his love.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lingering echo of a trumpet floated up
into the darkness from the Cour des Princes. André
started. Again that silvery note. The trumpets—the
silver trumpets—of the Chevau-légers de la Garde!
Was he dreaming? Was he at Fontenoy? No, no.
The King’s escort, ha! the King had returned. The
great <i>coup</i> had succeeded. The game was his just as
he had planned. Fortune, superbly beneficent, had
given him all. And then he clutched at the curtain,
sick, faint, gasping. For at the second trumpet note
the woman had turned to listen, the light fell on her
face—Denise! The thief was Denise!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>THE CHEVALIER MAKES HIS LAST APPEARANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Denise!</span> yes, it was Denise!</p>

<p>The sweat dripped off André’s face in the agony of
that moment. His fingers, his brain, his body, had
turned numb. Think, he could not. He was only
conscious of one thought, that burned red-hot. Fortune,
superbly maleficent, had kept her most devilish
revenge and punishment to the last. Denise must be
ruined by the man who loved her, for Louis, persuaded
to return by Madame de Pompadour at the instigation
of the Vicomte de Nérac, would be in this room in a
few minutes. This, and not the successful theft of the
despatch, was the vengeance of “No. 101.”</p>

<p>Fascinated by fear, André, tongue-tied, watched
Denise go straight up to the escritoire, insert a key,
open the drawer. And then love swept his horror
away, unloosed the paralysis that held him a prisoner,
and told him what to do. Denise could yet be saved by
instant flight. True, his scheme had failed; the wrath
of Madame de Pompadour and the King whom she had
deceived would fall on him; Madame would herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
probably be ruined. What did it matter, so that he
rescued Denise from the awful peril, the wiles which
“No. 101” had with such fiendish completeness laid
for her? For that it was “No. 101’s” diabolical plan
he had no doubt now. Yvonne had gulled and betrayed
him, as from the first.</p>

<p>But just as he wrenched the curtain aside and sprang
into the room with cry of “Denise!” she had tottered
back with a low exclamation of horror.</p>

<p>“Denise!”</p>

<p>The candle fell from her hand. In the darkness
he heard her sob. “Gone,” she muttered feebly.
“Gone!”</p>

<p>“Quick, the King is coming! For God’s sake, fly.
There is the key—the secret staircase. I will—can—explain
later.”</p>

<p>He hurried her towards the doorway with a terrible
yet tender energy of love.</p>

<p>“André,” she cried, “André, it is gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fly; fly, for God’s sake!”</p>

<p>“But it is gone—the secret despatch; it is not
there—stolen!” Her voice dropped to a whisper.
She was sobbing on his shoulder with fear and
horror.</p>

<p class="caption">The candle fell from her hand. “Gone!” she muttered feebly, “gone!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The words acted like a galvanic shock. Gone—stolen
already! This was more—much more—than he
had dreamed of. The full meaning of the situation was
revealed and it stunned him into action. In a second
he had the candle alight, and, mastering the faintness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
that gripped him, dashed at the escritoire. It was perfectly
empty. The secret despatch was not in it. Another
thief had already secured it—“No. 101”! He
put the candle very slowly down on the table and
turned to Denise, who was standing in the middle of
the room white to the lips.</p>

<p>André laughed, as men will laugh when tears and
passion are futile. That laugh at his own outwitting
by a girl and her English accomplice rang through the
room. The traitors had been before him. The secret
despatch was already in the hands of the King’s enemies,
of Madame de Pompadour’s enemies, of his. He
and she were ruined. Nothing could save them now.
In a few hours the English Government could publish
the truth, the Court could proclaim Madame by the
evidence of her own hand an intriguer against the
King, and Denise and he would be found here in
the darkness with an empty escritoire by Louis XV.
and Madame de Pompadour, to whom its contents were
a matter of life and death. Hopeless to struggle now.
Love had inspired a plan, but fate was stronger than
love. Madame de Pompadour must come, and hear
what had happened, from his lips. He had ruined
her, ruined himself, ruined Denise. Louis alone could
lie. Louis by a lie alone would escape. André had
matched himself, in his pride, against “No. 101,” a
girl, and this was the result.</p>

<p>“They told me,” Denise began, “it was here. We
threw with dice as to who should find it. We were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
determined to punish and destroy Madame de Pompadour.
I took my chance, and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he interrupted impatiently, for he had
already divined Denise’s motives.</p>

<p>“To save you before,” Denise went on, “I let her
escape and sinned against my conscience, for that
woman polluted Versailles, your life and mine. I owed
reparation; this was to be my reparation. You were
ruined, André, dismissed, disgraced. I cared no
longer for life—for anything. You I could not save,
but her I could punish, for she had broken my heart
and shattered your career in her selfishness. That is
why I came—willingly, gladly. It was a duty to my
cause—to myself.”</p>

<p>André knew nothing of the scheme of Mont Rouge,
of the loaded dice whereby the love of a wicked woman,
the Comtesse des Forges, turned to hatred, and a defeated
rival’s vengeance, had foisted on Denise the task
of braving alone the perils and the disgrace and of completing
the plot of the Court; but what he did know
showed him that the Court, too, like himself, had been
the victims of the man and the woman he had spied on
at the inn. But, unlike himself, the Court would gain
its vengeance.</p>

<p>“I performed a duty,” Denise was saying, “and instead,
André, I have ruined you. Your enemies have
stolen the despatch.”</p>

<p>Voices at the foot of the stairs. No time for explanation
now. But, thank God! Denise did not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
the truth nor of Madame de Pompadour’s and the
King’s return. One glance at the agony in her face,
the agony of a woman who loved, and André was
again inspired to a noble decision.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” he said with perfect calmness.
“I was here to watch, I confess, in the interests of His
Majesty; we had hoped to catch quite another person,
but it is you, Denise, whom my foes have lured into
the trap—our trap. I ask you for my sake to leave
me to explain all to Madame. Sweetheart”—he was
pleading now as he had never pleaded to any woman
before—“sweetheart, do not inflict on me the pain of
giving you into the hands of Madame. You will not;
you cannot do it.”</p>

<p>The glorious lie, aided by the power of his love over
her, prevailed. Denise took his key, and just in time
André had drawn the curtain when Madame de Pompadour
flung the door open. Face and figure were all
aglow with the triumphant victory she had won. She
had returned to place her heel on the necks of
the defeated, to drink the cup of vengeance to the
dregs.</p>

<p>André very quietly kissed her hands and removed
her cloak. The peace and happiness in his eyes, his
self-sacrifice had already brought him, showed that
love had by its own divine alchemy created for him a
new heaven and a new earth. He could face the
future with a tranquil confidence and bliss that surprised
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“<i>Mon cher</i>,” Madame cried, “I—no, you—have won.
The King is mine. I shall never lose him now.” Her
eyes ran over the room—fell on the open escritoire.
“Well, you have the traitor?”</p>

<p>“No, Madame.”</p>

<p>“What? They did not dare?” She laughed. “No
matter. The King is mine.”</p>

<p>“The paper has been stolen,” he said quietly, “and
the thief has escaped.”</p>

<p>Madame put her hand on her breast, tottered back a
step or two. Her radiant eyes grew cold. Incredulity
and fear made her an old woman. “Stolen? escaped?
Do you mean——?”</p>

<p>“They fooled me. The hour was midnight, as I
told you. I have been here three times waiting; the
thief never came, but the paper is gone.”</p>

<p>The meaning of his words trickled into her mind.
With a cry of rage she sprang at the escritoire and
turned it upside down. Then she hurled it into the
centre of the room, and wheeled on André. “Ah, <i>misérable,
coquin, lâche</i>!” the hot, incoherent words tumbled
over each other. “You have failed. It is me
you have fooled, betrayed. Ah, traitor, you are my
foe; gone, Seigneur Jésu, gone! Stolen; then I am
ruined; ruined; after all I have done.” She burst into
tears, racked by rage, terror, despair.</p>

<p>“I am no traitor.”</p>

<p>“Bah! I have done with you.” She paced up and
down. “Ah! that accursed ‘No. 101,’ accursed; what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
can I do? Ruined, ruined!” she sank into a chair
with a low moan.</p>

<p>André watched the candle-light flicker on her hair
and breast, on the shimmering folds of the beautiful
dress she had so unerringly selected to aid in reconquering
Louis. But a woman’s beauty, genius, and
passion, and ambition had fought in vain, for “No.
101” was stronger than all of these.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose with an exclamation of vindictive
and unholy exultation. She had picked a jewelled
pendant from the floor. “Ha!” she cried, “here is
proof of the thief you could not catch. Mademoiselle
Denise has been here; that jewel is hers and it fell by
the escritoire table; it is not ‘No. 101’ who has stolen
the despatch, it is the Marquise de Beau Séjour.”</p>

<p>André had turned deadly pale. He stared in impotent
silence. Yes, the jewel was Denise’s; on the
back he knew was a fatal D. And it was a pendant
that he himself, in a thrice happy hour, had given her.</p>

<p>“The King’s honour,” Madame said in her cruelly
cold voice, “is at stake in that despatch. And he will
not spare the thief even if she were of the blood-royal.
Nor will I. This is proof enough for me; I promise
you it will also be proof enough for His Majesty. I
have here a <i>lettre de cachet</i> which the King gave me,
already signed. But the name is not filled in. That
was to be done to-night with the thief’s name. And
filled in I swear it shall be. For unless the secret despatch
is in my hands by to-morrow morning at ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
o’clock the Marquise de Beau Séjour shall go to the
Bastille.”</p>

<p>“Madame!”</p>

<p>“You cannot deceive me. You are shielding her.
It is in your face. She is the thief. I repeat, to-morrow
at ten—not one minute longer, and had it not
been for our friendship I would have sent her there
to-night.”</p>

<p>André was still silent, striving to think, be calm. If
Denise were questioned she was ruined. Denise could
not tell a lie. Nor could she save her lover now by a
lie. “You can settle it,” Madame went on in her icy
anger, “with Mademoiselle. I care not how or for
what she gives way. Lovers’ confessions can be
sweet, they say. But my life, my honour, my future,
my dreams, my all, are at stake. Think you I will
allow a girl, a noble, a woman who has insulted
me, conspired against me, a thief of state secrets, to
defeat me—me! Then you do not know the woman
Antoinette de Pompadour.”</p>

<p>And André confessed to himself that till that moment
he did not.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said very quietly, “the Marquise de
Beau Séjour has not got the despatch, nor did she steal
it. However, I do not choose to discuss that now. I
shall return to this room at ten o’clock to-morrow. But
if I have the despatch by then I do not promise to give
it back to you.” Madame had turned her back on him;
she wheeled in a flash. “That will depend on some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
other things. But,” he bowed, “if the Marquise de
Pompadour imagines that she can call gentlemen
cowards and scoundrels with impunity, or that she can
so easily ruin the Marquise de Beau Séjour, she does
not know me—me, the man André de Nérac.”</p>

<p>And there he left her stunned into a fearful silence.
He was about to pass, he was aware, a night of despairing,
futile search, but it would not be such a prolonged
agony of torture as this woman, amidst the
litter of her humiliation, would endure. One last
chance remained. The girl he called “No. 101” and
George Onslow had arranged to meet at midnight at
“The Cock with the Spurs of Gold.” That agreement
might not prove as false as other things he had
overheard and been tricked into believing. If they were
there they would not leave the inn alive, for André,
too, had begun to divine the full meaning of this hellish
plot. His enemies at Court had planned with the
English traitors that they might ruin him and Denise
likewise. To-morrow he would reckon with the Duc
de Pontchartrain, the Comte de Mont Rouge, and the
Comtesse des Forges, as well as with Madame de Pompadour,
but to-night he had an account to settle with
“No. 101,” with George Onslow, with the Chevalier
de St. Amant, with Yvonne.</p>

<p>Only pausing to scribble a couple of orders, which
went off to Paris by mounted couriers, warned that
their royal master would brook of no delay, he gathered
a dozen of his guards and spurred his way to “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
Cock with the Spurs of Gold.” And as he galloped he
knew that in a couple of hours the police of Paris would
be sweeping every slum, ransacking every cabaret and
tavern, hunting down every suspect, and bribing for
information every <i>fille de joie</i> from the Faubourg St.
Antoine to the Faubourg St. Germain, from the Barrier
of the Hôpital St. Louis to the Barriers of Les
Gobelins, and the Palais Bourbon. And it was Denise
that he must save. Love—not the sham idol of gallantry—but
love can do things that neither the fear of
death nor of hell can.</p>

<p>The inn was plunged in darkness. Not a light to
be spied anywhere. André set his guards around it
and began to explore systematically. The outhouses
were empty save for Yvonne’s sleek cow contentedly
chewing the cud. Not a soul to be seen. Torch in
hand he strode into the parlour where he had been so
successfully befoiled. There were the chairs, the
screen, the tables.</p>

<p>Ha! on the centre table a piece of paper quite large.
No writing on it, but instead a mocking sign, two
crossed daggers roughly drawn in red and the mystic
number:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_dongle.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Blood, human blood! Blood still fresh and scarcely
dried. They had been here, the traitors; they had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
left long, for blood does not take long to dry, and they
had determined to flout their dupe with this ghastly
mummery. To Paris! to Paris! They could still be
caught before the October dawn was reddening the
roofs of the Conciergerie and the battlements of the
Bastille.</p>

<p>André wheeled with a hoarse command, and then
something, what he could not say, a swift intuition or
feeling, arrested him as he left the room. He hurled
the screen aside. Ah! Ah! A cry of horror broke
from him.</p>

<p>A man was lying behind it, face downwards, his
blood staining the mouse-gnawed boards. The man
was the Chevalier de St. Amant.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>THE CARREFOUR DE ST. ANTOINE NO. 3</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">André</span> saw in a moment from the Chevalier’s position
as he lay face downwards on the bare boards what
had happened. The unhappy boy had been stabbed
from behind; and he bore plain signs of having been
searched after he had been stabbed, for his clothes were
rumpled, his boots wrenched off, his stockings ripped
up, his shirt torn open. The searcher had then calmly
left him to bleed to death. Had the Chevalier been the
robber of the escritoire? If so had the secret despatch
been taken from him and the second thief escaped with
it? Who could say?</p>

<p>André kneeled down and gently lifted the prostrate
body on to the sofa.</p>

<p>“Go, two of you, at once to Versailles,” he cried to
his men, “and bring a doctor. Ride for your lives.”</p>

<p>He returned to the couch, but as he did so his boot
kicked against something that jingled. An English
guinea! George Onslow had been here, then.
André recognised with the intuition that is stronger
than proof that Onslow was the second thief, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
well as the man who had stabbed the Chevalier in
the back.</p>

<p>The Chevalier was not dead! A low moan from
the couch had echoed through the room, and André
poured brandy down his throat, stanched the wound,
and waited with feverish passion, for the Chevalier’s
lips were moving. His eyes opened—he saw who it
was at his side.</p>

<p>“Marie,” came the faint words, “Marie—the
Carrefour”—his head fell back.</p>

<p>André waited, overwhelmed by a wave of passion,
repentance, remorse. The Chevalier was no foe—he
was trying to tell him something, something of vital
importance to both of them; would he have the strength
to do it? Denise’s and his own fate hung on that.</p>

<p>“Marie,” trickled the feeble words, “Carrefour de
St. Antoine No. 3—” again he swooned, but André had
learned almost enough. It was time to leave him,
cruel as it seemed, for every half-hour now would be
precious.</p>

<p>“Marie—paper—save her—Onslow,” the Chevalier
was making a great effort; André guessed the rest.
But the Chevalier’s hand moved pleadingly. He was
asking for a promise—“save her,” he repeated and his
lips ceased to move.</p>

<p>André took the young man’s hand. He scarcely
knew what he was saying, he knew not who Marie was,
but in the presence of death, death inflicted by that
dastard stab in the back, a man who was inspired by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
love might well feel a great pity, the desire to forgive
and atone.</p>

<p>“I promise,” he whispered. “I promise.”</p>

<p>Moved by the beautiful peace that those two words
brought into the young man’s face, André kneeled beside
him. No doctor could save the Chevalier de St.
Amant now, but he, too, had loved Denise; he, too,
had charged by the side of the Chevau-légers de la
Garde at Fontenoy. And him at least an assassin’s
dagger had delivered from the justice of the King of
France and of Madame de Pompadour.</p>

<p>Sceptic as he was, André whispered a brief prayer,
and, as Denise would have wished him to do, reverently
made the sign of the Cross, commending his soul
to the God whose eyes are upon the truth, and whose
mercy is infinite.</p>

<p>As he stepped outside, into that clearing where
Yvonne had saved his own life, a sharp altercation apparently
in the outhouses at the back sent him hurrying
thither.</p>

<p>“Curse you, let me go, scum!” were the words he
heard, followed by a sharp scuffle.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Monsieur le Comte,” André said,
with icy sarcasm, “but the scum will not let you go.”</p>

<p>Mont Rouge’s livid face paled at his rival’s voice.
De Nérac least of all men had he expected to discover
at “The Cock with the Spurs of Gold.”</p>

<p>“You will keep Monsieur le Comte de Mont Rouge
a prisoner,” André commanded the guards who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
caught the Count, “until I return, and you will answer
with your heads for his safety.”</p>

<p>“By what right—” Mont Rouge began, savagely.</p>

<p>“That, Monsieur le Comte,” André interrupted,
politely, “you will learn when it suits me. But to-morrow
His Majesty will require to know by what
right an exiled gentleman is still at Versailles,” he
paused, “and why a noble of France trades under the
title of ‘Lui’ with traitors in the pay of the English
Government.”</p>

<p>It was a bold thrust, but it went home. The
mingled fear and rage in Mont Rouge’s cynical eyes
revealed the correctness of André’s guess.</p>

<p>“His Majesty,” André continued, “you will be interested
to know, has returned to Versailles to take
summary vengeance on all traitors.”</p>

<p>And as he galloped away he knew that Mont Rouge
was unaware of Louis’s unexpected return. That
Mont Rouge was at the inn at all showed that Onslow
and his accomplice had been expected to share the results
of their theft with the noble conspirators against
Madame de Pompadour.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>No. 3 in the deserted Carrefour de St. Antoine was
the house where Onslow had made love before, and in
that very room, with its barred shutters and tightly
drawn curtains, with its thick carpets into which the
foot noiselessly sank, and its blazing candles, the woman
whom André had spied on at “The Cock with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Spurs of Gold” now sat calmly destroying papers.
Every now and then she stopped to listen attentively;
twice at least she opened the door and peered out, but
there was no one, and she placidly resumed her task.</p>

<p>When all the papers were destroyed she surveyed
herself in the glass and smiled sadly. To-night her
jewels and her patrician virginal beauty gave her no
pleasure, yet she was dressed with consummate taste
and infinite care, as though she were going to a ball
in the Galerie des Glaces.</p>

<p>The clock struck half-past two. She moved behind
the curtains and unbarred the shutters, carefully pinning
them back, thus leaving the balcony not more than
ten feet up from the street quite clear. Then she blew
out all the candles but two and waited patiently.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed. This time when she rose she
carefully locked both side doors leading off the salon,
and when she returned from the passage she was accompanied
by Onslow. Unobserved, she locked that
door, too. There was no exit now from the room save
by the balcony.</p>

<p>Onslow’s sleuth-hound features wore a careworn
look, the look of the hunted man; his cloak and boots
were splashed with mud; he was breathing quickly,
for he had ridden hard.</p>

<p>“I was expecting you,” she surprised him by saying
quietly. “Why did you not bring the Chevalier with
you?”</p>

<p>“The Chevalier was obliged to stay at the inn,” was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
the grim reply. “You forget ‘Lui,’” he added hastily,
for her penetrating eyes were searching his face.
“Some one had to deal with the fool, and,” with a
laugh, “he will be astonished, will be ‘Lui.’”</p>

<p>“He will,” she said with such emphasis that Onslow
gave a guilty start. “‘Lui’ I expect at this moment
is in the hands of your friend and mine, the Vicomte de
Nérac.”</p>

<p>The oath that came from Onslow’s lips as he whipped
out a pistol, the look that accompanied it, were more
eloquent than an hour’s speech.</p>

<p>“De Nérac, I warned you, was an abler head than
yours, my friend; he was concealed in the room when
you and I arranged our little plan.”</p>

<p>“What?” Onslow sat down in consternation.</p>

<p>“It is as I say. Yvonne, the wench, was his accomplice.
She fooled you, that peasant girl; that is why
our programme was so suddenly altered.”</p>

<p>She walked away with her swinging, graceful carriage
of head and body. Had Onslow seen her eyes at
that moment it would not have relieved the fears that
haunted his face. But when she turned again she was
smiling seductively.</p>

<p>“You want the paper,” she said. “Here it is. I
keep my word, you see.” She quietly handed him the
secret despatch and he pounced on it as a hungry vulture
pounces on carrion.</p>

<p>“But how did you get it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I was at the Palace when the Chevalier stole it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
Stealing it was not an easy task, for the Vicomte de
Nérac was on the watch, but when I had got it I came
straight here. The Chevalier went back to the inn.
It would have been better,” she added carelessly,
watching him closely, “if he, too, had come here.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>The girl stooped and fastened her shoe, for she knew
that she could not always control her eyes. The shoe
fastened she was smiling again at Onslow’s trembling
fingers.</p>

<p>“There is blood upon your boot,” she remarked
pleasantly, “you have been stepping in blood. Whose,
I wonder?” She moved towards the curtain, and
listened attentively, while she affected to pull the string.</p>

<p>“So De Nérac knew of the plan?” Onslow growled
out. “That explains a good deal, but not all.”</p>

<p>“You are right. If De Nérac meets the Chevalier
at the inn he may know more,” was the calm response.
She had begun to take off her jewels and was packing
them one by one into a leather case.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“This. The game is up for you, my friend, and for
me. There will be no more richly paid treachery for
some time in our lives. The Chevalier loves me, loves
me as his own soul. To save me he will probably betray
what De Nérac does not already know——”</p>

<p>Onslow had risen. He buttoned up his coat over the
despatch, while his eyes glowed with the unholy lust
that was corroding his mind and body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“And,” she continued, “the Chevalier knows that
I love him, love him more dearly than any man. I
shall be grateful to his love if it saves him and saves
me, as I think it will. But it cannot save you, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” his breath came quick. His eyes went
round and round like those of a beast tracked by dogs
to its lair.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope he will confess all.” She faced him.
“I tell you now that he went to the inn to confess all—all.”</p>

<p>“Then,” Onslow answered in a thick voice of brutal
exultation, “he will not do it. He is dead, your
Chevalier, your lover—dead.”</p>

<p>She suppressed the cry of horror, of agony, that was
wrung from her. But her great blue eyes fixed on
him. “You killed him?” she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>She sank into a chair and covered her face with her
hands. She was not crying. This was a sorrow too
deep for tears.</p>

<p>Suddenly Onslow darted forward. The girl, too,
sprang up. A horse’s hoofs, several horses’ hoofs,
clattering furiously on the stones of the deserted Carrefour
could be heard distinctly for those who had ears to
hear.</p>

<p>“Miserable libertine!” she cried, in a terrible voice,
“assassin! Your hour has come as I told you it would.
You will not leave this house alive, and I am glad,
very glad. Stand back!” she said peremptorily, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
she had whipped out a pistol. “The doors are locked,
all of them. Dear God! I could slay you with my own
hands, but it is not necessary.”</p>

<p>She had swiftly stolen behind the curtains. There
was a moment’s pause while Onslow in vain tried to
force the door by which he had entered. There was a
crash, a wrench, and then the curtains were drawn
back.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Vicomte de Nérac—Monsieur George
Onslow,” the girl said quietly, as if she were introducing
two gentlemen in a lady’s salon. She had flung
the window open and André, sword in hand, was standing
in the room, looking about him half dazed but
triumphant.</p>

<p>“That man there,” she proceeded in her tearless
voice, pointing at Onslow, “is an English spy. In his
pocket is the secret despatch of Madame de Pompadour
which you seek. He is the assassin, by his own confession,
of the Chevalier de St. Amant, and he has also
a valuable letter in the handwriting of the Comte de
Mont Rouge. Monsieur le Vicomte, you will deal with
him as and how you please, but if you have any pity
for the blood of the man who sent you to this place you
will have no mercy for a coward, a libertine, and an
assassin. Adieu!”</p>

<p>She had swiftly unlocked one of the side doors,
glided through it, and relocked it from the other side,
leaving Onslow and André face to face.</p>

<small>ANDRÉ FAILS TO DECIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Onslow</span> had the advantage of André in his intimate
knowledge of the essential facts of the situation; and
he had not been for ten years an agent of the secret
service, in daily peril of his life, in hourly need of having
to decide at once on a course of action, without
learning all that an able and desperate man can
learn from pitting his wits against the wits of men
and women as unscrupulous and desperate as himself.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Vicomte,” he now said, bowing
politely. “I could not have wished for a more opportune
meeting. As a proof, there are my pistols,” he
tossed them ostentatiously on to the table.</p>

<p>André drew the curtains behind him, threw off his
cloak, and advanced into the centre of the room.</p>

<p>“You killed the Chevalier?” he demanded briefly.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Shall I tell you why? Because he had
betrayed me; because, rather, he was the lover of the
woman who betrayed me. That woman is the ‘No.
101’ you have sought for so long, who has baffled you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
before and has baffled you again to-night. She is a
liar as well as a wanton.”</p>

<p>André quietly shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Let us come to business,” Onslow said coolly.
“The secret despatch, I regret to say, is not in my
possession. It would have been in ten minutes, but it
is still in the keeping of the charming spy, who is probably
now on her way to the frontier. Madame de
Pompadour will hear more of it before long, but that
does not concern you. What does,” he held out a
paper, “is this letter in the handwriting of the Comte
de Mont Rouge.”</p>

<p>Onslow’s tone had the calmness of conviction, and
if he spoke the truth André knew he had failed miserably.
It was more than probable that “No. 101” had
again baffled him. For the despatch was more important
to her than to Onslow.</p>

<p>“Well?” André said, to gain time for his mind to
work.</p>

<p>“If you have this letter, Vicomte, you can ruin your
enemies to-morrow. Let me tell you that Mademoiselle
Denise was by loaded dice, the device of another beautiful
wanton and her accomplice, the writer of this
letter,” he held it out, “yes, Mademoiselle Denise was
chosen to steal the despatch in order that she, as well
as you, might be destroyed. I see you did not know
that. It is worth having, that letter.”</p>

<p>Onslow recognised at once he had struck the right
chord. André’s face would have terrified the Comtesse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
des Forges, and it surprised himself as he caught a
glimpse of it in the glass. Men in the white heat of
wrath and baffled revenge so seldom see what their
faces express.</p>

<p>“You can kill me, of course,” Onslow went on
easily. “I am an English spy. But you will not get
the letter nor the despatch in that way. Why? Because
I haven’t the one, and before you can run me
through the letter will be in the fire.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” André commanded, for Onslow was very
near the stove and the letter was very precious.</p>

<p>“For five minutes only,” Onslow retorted. “Give
me your word of honour that you will let me go free
and you shall have the letter—or I destroy it and fight
for my life as best I can. Make up your mind,
Vicomte.”</p>

<p>The clock ticked very loud and clear while André
weighed the issues. The letter was precious; it was
there, which the despatch was not; time was more
precious still, for there remained “No. 101” to be
dealt with. Onslow’s life was of no value to Denise or
himself. André studied the secret agent’s calm face
for three silent minutes.</p>

<p>“Give me the letter,” he said at last, “you shall go
free, on my word of honour.”</p>

<p>“I thank you. But you have decided wisely.”
Onslow placed the letter on the table. “And now,”
he buttoned up his cloak, “kindly write me a pass, for
I must leave your accursed city before dawn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>“The password at the Barrier of the Hospital of St.
Louis is, ‘<i>La santé du Roi</i>,’” André answered. “That
will take you through in safety.”</p>

<p>Onslow bowed. “My compliments, Vicomte; your
precautions devised at such short notice do you infinite
credit. I fancy we shall meet again, but not in the
salon of ‘the Princess’ either in Paris or London.”</p>

<p>André had moved towards the writing-table. “I
had better write you a pass after all,” he said, very
politely, “the police are not so scrupulous as I am
about a pledge of honour.”</p>

<p>Onslow fell into the trap. Like many clever men
who find a lie succeed beyond their expectations, he
wholly misunderstood the motives that had persuaded
the other to accept for truth what he feared was untrue.
André had turned his back to write, but he had
hardly scrawled three words when he wheeled with incredible
swiftness.</p>

<p>“No!” he cried, “you don’t stab two men in the
back unawares in one night, traitor and spy.”</p>

<p>For that was what Onslow had, dagger in hand,
stealthily crept up to do, inspired by the sight of
André’s apparently defenceless position at the writing-table
and by the desire to wipe out a long score. But
a chair hurled with terrible force met him full in the
stomach, and when he had recovered he was facing the
sword point of the finest swordsman in Paris. He had
lost his pistols, and the death his lies had averted so
skilfully was at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>“I will tell you where you can find the secret despatch,”
the spy pleaded, “if you will let me go.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to kill you,” André answered. “A
De Nérac’s sword is not to be soiled with the carrion
blood of an English hireling and assassin. The public
executioner will deal with you, not I.”</p>

<p>He whistled sharply. Three of the guards swung
themselves in by the balcony.</p>

<p>“Disarm and bind that scoundrel,” was the brief
order, and in three minutes a wounded prisoner had
been securely tied hand and foot. Five minutes later
George Onslow was on his way to a police cell, and
André was standing alone in the beautiful salon, with
the secret despatch and Mont Rouge’s damning letter
in his possession.</p>

<p>He walked up and down trying to believe that his
amazing good fortune was really true. The terrible
strain of the last twelve hours had at last begun to tell,
and, instead of the triumphant joy that he had imagined
would be his should he achieve the impossible and recover
the despatch, he was only conscious of complete
mental and physical exhaustion, of a strange and utter
weariness. The power of his mind seemed broken.
His ambition had melted away. He had no doubt
saved Madame de Pompadour, the King’s secret would
remain a secret, and Denise would emerge scathless
from the awful ordeal into which she had been plunged.
The love for which he had plotted, schemed, and
worked would be his now. Yes, he had gained all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
which ambition had inspired him to dream, more than
all, for he had only to put into Madame de Pompadour’s
hands that guilty letter, and the men and women
who had dabbled in treason to sate their jealousy and
their lust for vengeance would be condemned to pass
from the Salon de Vénus and the Œil de Bœuf to the
scaffold.</p>

<p>Success! a Croix de St. Louis, a Cordon Bleu already!
To-morrow he might be Minister for War, in the years
to come he might share with the <i>bourgeoise</i> mistress of
his Sovereign the rule of France. But at what a cost?
As Madame de Pompadour had done and must always
do, by sleepless intrigue and scheming, by playing on
the fears and fancies, the bigotry and animal passions
of the King, by checkmating or degrading the <i>noblesse</i>
into an odious and reluctant submission. He had won
power so far by such ways. It could only be kept at
Versailles by the same hateful, sordid scuffling, and he,
the man, must daily train himself to keep his place by
trading on the weakness of women, from the kitchen
wenches to the mistress of the robes, by trafficking in
the selfish plans of gamblers as ambitious and unscrupulous
as himself. Versailles was there, the King was
there; Louis was what he would always be, an impenetrable
sensualist and the despot of France. More bitter
still, the life of the Court as he and she knew it was what
he must ask Denise now to share and to lead. The
first offering of their marriage feast would be the disgrace,
perhaps the blood, of the men of his own order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
who had been his friends, by whose side he had fought
for France, and of the women to whom—. Bah! it was
a revolting thought. Little, indeed, had he foreseen
when he rode down the hill from the Castle of Beau
Séjour, and swore that at all costs and by all means he
would win Denise, what success might and did mean.
Well, ah well! he had learned it at last.</p>

<p>Ah! in this bitter hour, if it had not been for Denise,
he would have flung despatch and letter into the fire,
and left Paris to cast its mystic spell of tears and
laughter on other men, and let him go free, deaf to the
siren song of the ambitions born of their mother, the
enchantress of cities.</p>

<p>Success! Yet had he succeeded after all? Surely
not. “No. 101” had escaped. Futile to seek her
now. Her papers had been destroyed. She was
doubtless provided with a pass. Proof against her
there was none. And the mystery with which his
search had begun was as great as it had ever been.
Yvonne had vanished, the Chevalier de St. Amant was
dead, and the woman herself had passed triumphantly
into the moonlit autumn night. How strange and
puzzling it all was. Yet, had not indeed the Chevalier
put him on the track, had she herself not delivered
that assassin and spy into his power? In a few days
not even Onslow—and who would believe Onslow?—would
be able to reveal what he knew. The secret
whose fascination lured men to their ruin would remain
a secret, and the little he had discovered would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
buried in the tombs of the De Néracs. This girl had
matched herself against all the brains and resources of
a great government and had defeated King, mistress,
and ministers, not once, but every time. Worse, far
worse, what she had done in the past she could repeat
in the future. That eternal struggle for power at Versailles
which was to be his and Denise’s life from to-day
would be haunted and poisoned, perhaps thwarted
and brought to ruin, by the same strange treachery.
The blood of the Chevalier would taint the life of
Denise and himself and of Madame de Pompadour and
the King for ever.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece chimed out four.
André stopped his pacing. He must return to Versailles,
but as he crossed the room he caught a glimpse
of his haggard, sleepless face and burning eyes in the
mirror, and he halted and with trembling fingers turned
the clock sharply round. He had spied the reflection
of a familiar crest on the reverse of the timepiece.
“<i>Dieu Le Vengeur!</i>” He had not been wrong. The
words were written round the crest. “<i>Dieu Le
Vengeur!</i>”</p>

<p>André drew a deep breath, he looked all round the
room with a shiver. What did it— A rustle of a
woman’s dress. The great curtains were quickly
drawn aside. The Princess, as he had seen her first in
London with the blood-red flowers on her breast, was
watching him, pale and beautiful.</p>

<p>“Why should the clock not be there?” she asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
as if she were continuing a conversation. “Are you so
ignorant of Paris, Vicomte, as not to know that the
salon in which you stand once belonged to the owners
of the clock? It is a fine motto and truer than most.
‘<i>Amour fait tout</i>,’ for example.” She had smilingly
selected the motto of the De Néracs. “You don’t
agree?”</p>

<p>“I did not come here,” André answered, “to discuss
mottoes.”</p>

<p>The appearance of this woman had awakened all his
latent anger, his sense of defeat. She should not
escape him again.</p>

<p>“No, but to do my business,” she retorted. “I see
you have won your despatch and your letter”—they
were lying on the table—“and I gladly infer that you
have given a scoundrel his deserts. For that I thank
you from the bottom of my heart. One libertine and
traitor less in the world is a blessing even to women
such as I am.”</p>

<p>Her perfect calm, the complete absence of fear, the
extraordinary strangeness of their meeting, the crest
and motto on the clock, had reduced André to impotent
silence. The Princess and crystal-gazer quietly sat
down. “One question before you go,” she said in a
changed tone—“did Onslow tell the truth when he said
that the Chevalier de St. Amant was dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She stretched her arms,—the gesture was curiously
familiar to André,—but she said nothing for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
minutes. “It is fate,” was her comment in a tearless
voice when she spoke at last. “Fate!” she rose,
“fate, dear God!” She was staring with knitted
fingers into the cold shadows cast by the four flickering
candles. And André was more moved by the sight of
her stern, impassive self-restraint than if she had wept.
Surely she had loved the dead man, for he was in the
company of a sorrow too sacred to be fathomed even
by herself.</p>

<p>“Why did you come back,” he asked bitterly, “why
did you come back?”</p>

<p>She awoke from her reverie. “Where could I go?”
she answered. “To ‘The Cock with the Spurs of
Gold’?” She shivered. “To ‘The Gallows and the
Three Crows,’ where your police are now? To the
Barriers that are guarded by your men? I had not
the password. The man who would have given it to
me, had I chose to ask it, I have sent to his account.
No, my friend, I prefer to be arrested by a gentleman
who will do his duty like a gentleman, and will not
chaffer with me as if I were a street-walker.”</p>

<p>André wiped the perspiration from his brow. The
woman smiled and approached him.</p>

<p>“Come, Vicomte,” she said. “It is disagreeable,
perhaps, for André de Nérac to arrest a beautiful
woman, but you have kept your men waiting quite
long enough in the Carrefour out there. Onslow has
gone to the Bastille? Yes? Then do me the favour of
sending me to Vincennes. I cannot share the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
prison as that miscreant murderer.” She walked
towards the curtains. André guessed she was about
to signal to the square.</p>

<p>“Stop,” he cried, in sharp despair, “stop!”</p>

<p>“You have no choice,” she said. “Are you aware
that I have been tracked to this house; that it is known
to your police, warned by yourself four hours ago, that
I have not left it? Do you doubt my word? Then
look.” She cautiously drew back a curtain on the
panelled wall which covered a small window. André,
with the curtain behind him shutting out the light,
stared into the moonlit court at the back. When he
let the curtain fall his face wore almost the look of the
hunted felon.</p>

<p>“Well; you recognised them,” the Princess said
calmly. “Four, I think. Yes? They are Madame
de Pompadour’s men,” she added. “She does not
trust you, poor woman; she, too, sent messages from
Versailles, and she will wish to know in the morning
the reason why you have not arrested the impudent
hussy who derided her at an inn, who is a traitor into
the bargain, and who was in your power, alone, undefended,
and with the evidence of her guilt staring you
in the face.” She quietly touched the despatch and
the letter lying on the table. “Unless, my friend, you
wish to join George Onslow, the Comte de Mont
Rouge, and myself in the cells you had better do your
duty.”</p>

<p>André feverishly took up the papers; he looked now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
towards the great window into the Carrefour, now towards
that hateful little outlook into the court where
he knew the sleuth-hounds of an ambitious woman
dogged their guilty prey.</p>

<p>“It is useless to destroy the papers,” the Princess remarked
placidly. “That will only send Mademoiselle
de Beau Séjour to join our pleasant party at the Bastille.
Madame de Pompadour is a great and beautiful
woman, but like all really ambitious men and women
she has no mercy, and she naturally does not wish to
take our places in the cells. She is fighting for her life
and love as you are. Come, Vicomte, be reasonable.
In five minutes it will be all over and you will return
a hero to Versailles. Remember what awaits you
there.”</p>

<p>Every sentence in this calmly terrible speech made
André feel more misery than he could have believed a
man could endure.</p>

<p>“Why be in any doubt?” she began again.</p>

<p>“Oh, for God’s sake—” he pleaded. “For God’s
sake——”</p>

<p>“No, you must hear me out. The proof of my
treachery is here; they, these men, will find it on me”;
she had drawn a paper from her breast. “Do you know
what that is? It is a copy of the secret despatch; it is
addressed to the agent who would convey it to England,
and it is signed.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_350">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Yvonne, of course; Yvonne of the spotless ankles,”
she lifted her dress a few inches.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>She held it up and in the flickering light André could
see the red mystic sign of the crossed daggers and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
cipher number. He shivered as she replaced it in her
bosom. “The game is up for me,” she said in her impassive
voice. “That paper will send me to the scaffold,
and unless you arrest me it will send you too.”</p>

<p>“You are mad,” he cried incoherently, and he really
believed what he said. “You are mad.”</p>

<p>“Was the woman mad who tricked you at Fontenoy,
who has tricked and befooled you at every turn since
you came back? I have betrayed your country, your
King, your army, yourself, and yet you, a noble hating
treason, loving France, hesitate to arrest the traitress
whom you have sworn to bring to justice. It is you
who are mad, my friend, not I; or shall I say,” she
had dropped her eyes and curtsied, “Monseigneur is
too good?”</p>

<p>“Yvonne!” the exclamation burst from his lips.
He was leaning heavily on a chair and peering dazed
into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yvonne, of course; Yvonne of the Spotless Ankles,”
she lifted her dress a few inches. “Yvonne whom at
the bidding of another woman you were to make your
tool. Did you? I think not, for the Vicomte de Nérac
can be more easily tricked by women into doing what
they please than the most unscrupulous libertine in
France. But you must take your revenge on Yvonne
now.”</p>

<p>Yvonne! André’s brain reeled. Yvonne, who had
saved his life, was a traitress, the traitress whose
crimes merited condign punishment, whom now, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
the devilish device of fate, he must arrest and send to
a felon’s death to save himself and Denise.</p>

<p>He seized her arm. “Who and what are you?” he
cried, beside himself, for the torture of the fascinating
riddle racked him beyond endurance.</p>

<p>“That,” she replied with her slow smile, “is my
secret and it will perish with me. Do your duty,
Vicomte, and return to Versailles. Madame de Pompadour
awaits you; the blood of the <i>noblesse</i>, her foes,
will atone in her eyes. She has triumphed, and so
have you. Go back to your King, take him the proof
of his royal intrigues, destroy the noble traitors who
would have destroyed you. Love and revenge, the
sweetest things the world can give a man, are yours.
Are they not enough?” She was coolly taunting him,
and out there in the court-yard waited the police ready
to arrest a traitress with the proof of her crime on her
person. Was ever a man in so cruel and tragic a
position?</p>

<p>“Why do you waver?” she asked very quietly.
“Is it because of Denise?”</p>

<p>He met her gaze. This was not the crystal-gazer,
nor the “Princess,” nor even Yvonne who spoke. It
was another woman, from whom all that was hateful,
cynical, insolent, had vanished. André’s hands on his
chair trembled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, in a low voice, “were it not for
Denise and Denise’s sake alone I would destroy these papers
and would take you past the Barriers myself. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
saved my life once, more than once, for you could have
killed me in the cabin at Fontenoy; you and the Chevalier—God
rest his soul—enabled me to save the honour
of Denise—Denise.” He paused for emotion. “You
have enabled me to save my own honour. Why you
did these things I do not know. But I would to-night,
and now, take you past the Barrier of St. Louis,
and I would then bid Versailles and you adieu for ever.
God alone can judge you, not I—but Denise—there is
Denise——”</p>

<p>“Then Denise herself must decide.”</p>

<p>She was mad after all; stark mad. He stood helplessly
picking at the embroidered upholstery of the
chair. Mad, mad; they were all mad.</p>

<p>The woman had glided towards the door on the
right. André looked up exultingly. Ha! She was
gone—fled. Then he, too, must escape at once. He
gathered up the papers, seized his cloak, and darted
towards the window, only to start back with a cry.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the doorway stood Denise.</p>

<p>He stood spellbound. Yes, it was Denise.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> came forward with outstretched hands.
“André,” she asked with passionate eagerness, “you
are safe?”</p>

<p>He took her to his breast, looking into her eyes.
“Sweetheart,” he whispered, “why are you here?”</p>

<p>“Because you sent for me,” she began innocently.</p>

<p>“Sent for you?” he repeated, in dull bewilderment.
“Mad,” he muttered, “mad, mad.” His brain was
beginning to break down.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered, for his face frightened her,
“you sent for me. See; read.”</p>

<p>André took the strip of paper from her. After a few
minutes he was able to spell out these words:</p>

once to Paris. Carrefour de St. Antoine No. 3.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">André.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The paper dropped. The writing was his, at least
it appeared to be. Could he have written it? He
searched his whirling thoughts, recalling the events of
this awful night following on the King’s illness, the
strain of waiting in Madame de Pompadour’s room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
after the scene at the inn, the discovery of Denise, the
interviews that followed, the finding of the Chevalier
and Mont Rouge, the gallop to Paris, and then all that
had happened in this salon. He snatched at the paper
again; he had not written it; no, it was a clever
forgery, the work of the only woman who could do it—“No.
101.”</p>

<p>Denise was watching him in terror, for his lips
moved, yet he said nothing.</p>

<p>“A girl called Yvonne,” she whispered, “brought it
to me at midnight; she conducted me to this house,
and I have been waiting here ever since, waiting for
you. Yvonne has disappeared and the doors were all
locked. There is only the woman who——”</p>

<p>They both turned sharply at the rustle of a dress and
stood hand in hand gazing in silence, for there had
entered the girl whom André had seen plotting with
Onslow at “The Cock with the Spurs of Gold.”</p>

<p>André mechanically whipped off his hat, Denise
mechanically answered the curtsey of the lady who had
entered, for this was a gentlewoman of their own rank,
whose beauty would have adorned the great hall in the
Château de Beau Séjour.</p>

<p>“We agreed,” she began quietly, “that Mademoiselle
la Marquise was to decide. Monsieur le Vicomte,
what I have to say is for the ears of Mademoiselle
alone. Permit me to show you where you can wait.
I shall not keep you long.” She pointed with her fan
to the door and then held out her fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>André walked out of the room like one in a dream.
The door closed. The two women were alone.</p>

<p>“I can be brief,” the stranger said quietly. “You
have heard of ‘No. 101’; you know of the stealing of
the secret despatch. I am the thief. I am ‘No.
101.’”</p>

<p>Denise recoiled with a cry of horror, her eyes fixed
on the girl’s face with an expression of indignant
stupefaction.</p>

<p>“The Vicomte de Nérac,” the stranger proceeded,
“knows what you know now, and he will return to
Versailles a hero,” she paused, “if he will arrest me.
He has the despatch; he has a letter which will convict
the Comte de Mont Rouge, who, Mademoiselle, by
loaded dice, sent you to be the thief of the Court. The
Vicomte has been seen to come here; it has also been
discovered that I am in this house, and unless he returns
to Versailles with that despatch he will be ruined
and Madame de Pompadour will also send you to the
Bastille, for she has proof that you were in her room
this night. The Vicomte is in great danger, and you
were summoned here to save him, for at your bidding
alone will he do his duty and arrest the traitress—myself.”</p>

<p>Denise’s indignation had already begun to melt.
She freed the necklace at her throat as if it were choking
her.</p>

<p>“Shall I now ask the Vicomte to return?” The
girl moved towards the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>“Wait—one moment! You are”—Denise broke off
in agitation—“you are Yvonne?” she whispered.</p>

<p>The stranger sat down and unconcernedly began to
tear up one of the sheets of paper littering the floor.
“I am,” she answered quietly.</p>

<p>“And you gave the Vicomte de Nérac the secret despatch
which you stole?”</p>

<p>“He took it from the English agent to whom I had
given it.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Again Denise had guessed the truth.
“You once saved the Vicomte’s life?” she went on.</p>

<p>“I helped to do so.”</p>

<p>“Yet you are a traitress?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am a traitress, and a traitress I should have
continued to be if you and the Vicomte de Nérac had
not stepped in to prevent me.”</p>

<p>The emotionless voice in which this confession was
made had ceased to startle Denise, for she was scanning
the girl’s face intently.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she cried with sudden conviction, “the
Chevalier de St. Amant is your brother!”</p>

<p>The other looked up quickly. “Was my brother,”
she corrected gently. “The Chevalier de St. Amant
is dead.”</p>

<p>“Merciful God!” Denise was leaning against a
chair, faint and white.</p>

<p>“He was killed at the inn by the English agent,
from whom in this room the Vicomte de Nérac took the
secret despatch.” Denise had covered her face with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
her hands. “And you are right, Mademoiselle; the
Chevalier was my brother, who helped me till to-night
to be the traitress that I am.”</p>

<p>“Silence,” Denise cried in anguish. “Oh, for God’s
sake be silent!”</p>

<p>“The truth,” replied the other in her passionless
voice, “can never be silent.”</p>

<p>Denise walked to and fro, wrung by a torture unendurable
to a woman’s soul.</p>

<p>Suddenly she paused. “Do you know,” she demanded,
“that your brother saved the Vicomte de
Nérac when he might have ruined him?”</p>

<p>“I know more than that. Yes, Mademoiselle, I
know that what he did was done because he loved
you. That also is the truth.”</p>

<p>Denise caught at her arms. The question in her
gesture and her eyes needed no words. The girl rose
and faced her.</p>

<p>“When we parted at the foot of Madame de Pompadour’s
stairs his last words were, ‘Unless Denise or the
Vicomte gets the paper Denise is ruined.’ The paper
was in my possession and my brother went back to the
inn to explain to the English agent why he could not
have it.”</p>

<p>“But why did you not give me the paper at Versailles—you
came to me as Yvonne—you——”</p>

<p>“If I had given you the paper at Versailles should I
have been here now? I loved my life a little then—I
did not know my brother’s fate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>And Denise had no answer but a shiver of mute
assent.</p>

<p>“You have forgotten my brother, who was to come
here to meet me that we might fly together; you have
also forgotten the Vicomte, to whom that despatch was
a necessity, and you have forgotten yourself, Mademoiselle.
Could my brother, who loved you, have
wished that you should at Versailles have been proved
to have stolen what you had tried to steal? You have
forgotten Madame de Pompadour. Would she or the
King have believed your story that a peasant girl had
given you the despatch?” She paused for a moment.
“Would the Vicomte have believed it?”</p>

<p>“André?” Denise cried passionately. “How dare
you?”</p>

<p>“There was only one way,” the girl continued,
quietly ignoring that cry of love’s conviction, “to save
you from the trap into which your enemies had lured
you, and that was to bring the Vicomte and yourself
here. My brother would have wished it, and I am
glad that I tried and succeeded.”</p>

<p>She turned away; her voice showed that the wonderful
strength of will which had sustained her was giving
way at last.</p>

<p>“You did it,” Denise said after a long silence, “not
for my sake, not wholly for your brother’s, but—because
you love André.”</p>

<p>The girl, who had sunk on to the sofa, presently rose
and crossed the room, and Denise, watching her as only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
one woman can watch another, shrank at the sight of
that noble and pathetic beauty.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the unfaltering answer, “I did it because
I love André, because I alone can save him.
Ah! it is not you, but I—I, who have saved
him.”</p>

<p>Denise gazed at her in silent helplessness. Fate was
too strong for them all. The clock chimed out five
strokes into the awful quiet of the room, and as Denise,
in her restless misery, walked past the fireplace with
its sculptured marble chimney-piece, she halted with
a sharp-drawn breath. The crest on the clock had
caught her eye, for the motto on it was “<i>Dieu Le
Vengeur!</i>”</p>

<p>“Before we part,” she cried, “you will tell me, you
must, who you are—no,” she added, in a stricken
voice, “it is not necessary. I know, I know. Ah,
God! this is terrible. ‘<i>Dieu Le Vengeur!</i>’” She
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>A quiet hand was laid on her shoulder. “Denise.”</p>

<p>For some moments they looked at each other in
breathless silence.</p>

<p>“It is true; yes it is true, and you—you have
guessed because you are a woman who loves. Ah!
when your ancestors were as nothing mine were the
nobles who made kings, who were leading the armies
of France. I am a traitress, but to what?” her voice
rang out. “To the man called Louis the Fifteenth, a
craven, a bigot, a liar, a libertine, the victim of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
priests and his lusts. That man is not France, not
your France and mine. Listen. What would you
have done if the King—the King,” her scorn was immeasurable,
“had stolen your mother, deserted her,
sent your father to the scaffold for treason that he never
committed? if you, the only daughter, had been saved
from infamy and beggary by two faithful servants and
brought up in secret to know that your name was corrupted,
your brother a starveling in exile, your lands
given to another? To that King I bear no allegiance
and will bear none, so help me God, God who can
avenge.”</p>

<p>“Then——”</p>

<p>“Do not say that name. It is blotted out, but it is
mine. Fifteen years ago, a child, I swore, and every
year since I have sworn it on the grave that is called
mine, that I would have revenge.”</p>

<p>Denise answered with pale lips, “Yes, revenge.”</p>

<p>“My brother and I planned and plotted revenge and
we succeeded. The Court and the King can judge of
that. Beauty was mine and I nourished it for revenge,
I used it for revenge, but I have never forgotten, never,
that I am a daughter of the <i>noblesse</i>, a woman as proud
of my womanhood as you, Denise.”</p>

<p>“Thank God,” she murmured gently.</p>

<p>“To the world I was simply a number, to myself a
sexless tool, living for one object alone, until you came
into my brother’s life, and then, ah, then, I dreamed
of the day when my brother should win through you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
what is his by right—should be Marquis de Beau
Séjour. But——”</p>

<p>Denise took her hand.</p>

<p>“If that were only all.” She paused for a moment,
overcome. “In London André came into my life.
Till that fatal day I have inspired many men with the
passion they call love. I thought I alone of women
knew not what love could be, but another dream came
to haunt me. It could not be. You did not love
François. André did not love me. Some day he will
tell you the story; the truth he must never know.”</p>

<p>“And your brother——”</p>

<p>“Yes, he worked for you as best he could and I for
André. Remember what we were and how we were
placed. But we have succeeded—love brought us
through. We remembered our Beau Séjour, and you
whom he loved, he whom I loved, will share it between
you. I thank God for that. My mother,” the girl
went on, “was a De Nérac, a cousin of André’s
mother. Had justice been done fifteen years ago
André’s father should have had my forfeited lands.
But love will do what justice could not—your love and
mine.”</p>

<p>“André can restore you your name, your honour.
He shall, he must.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible. You cannot change the King.
He would not, could not, undo the past—his past. My
brother is dead, my family will die with me as will my
secret. Fate is too strong for you, for me, for France.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
With François I worked to destroy the woman who
now rules at Versailles and will continue to rule. And
André from love for you strove to defeat us. Madame
de Pompadour has triumphed over the Court, the
<i>noblesse</i>, the Church, my brother, and you. Remember
the past and to-night. Remember you can only
ruin that woman by ruining yourself, by ruining
André, and you will not save me. I see it all now.
It is the destiny of France, and against the destiny of
God’s will we must fight in vain.”</p>

<p>Denise had clasped her hands like one listening to
the sentence of a supreme power. Were they not all
caught alike in the web of a mysterious and inscrutable
force, mere puppets as it seemed in a stupendous drama
whose beginning and whose end were beyond all human
insight and control, but puppets also of flesh and
blood, whose passions and whose spirit, whose ambitions
and whose ideals, whose souls and bodies so
strong and so weak, gave to the drama the immortal
breath of life? If—ah, if—Denise wrung her hands
again. How few are there of those born of women
from whom has not been wrung that bitter cry of revolt
against the “if” of fate—if only they had been
taught that out of the past comes the present and out
of the present will come the future, and that they, the
puppets, must make, every hour, their own lives and
the lives of all others.</p>

<p>“You cannot save your France and mine,” the girl
was saying. “She is doomed, doomed. The writing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
is on the walls. Ruin is coming on kings and nobles
and the people. In ten, twenty, perhaps fifty years
there will be a new France, for the greatness of my
people and yours no power can crush. Voices are crying
out in the streets of Paris to-day, but France will
not listen. She is drunk, mad, diseased, corrupt. Yet
I know it, it has been revealed to me, that there is a
glorious future for our country, and see to it that the
sons of what to-day is called Beau Séjour shall be in
the hour of that rebirth on the side of the new France.”</p>

<p>She moved quietly to the door, opened it, and called
softly, “Mademoiselle has decided. Come.”</p>

<p>As André entered he gazed from one to the other
with the calmness of a great fear. What had he come
to be told? He saw Denise’s mind was made up, and
he knew he must obey.</p>

<p>“André,” she said, with dignified composure, “you
will please bring the chief of police from the court-yard
to this room.”</p>

<p>For an instant he wavered, then controlling his emotion
he left the room. When he returned with the
chief of police one woman, hooded and cloaked, alone
was there.</p>

<p>Denise threw back the girl’s cloak which she had
slipped on. The police agent started with intense
surprise.</p>

<p>“You recognise me, Monsieur,” Denise said freezingly.
“Yes, it is the Marquise de Beau Séjour, and
one of the maids of honour to her Majesty, who is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
accustomed to be shadowed when she visits a house
that belongs to herself, as this does.”</p>

<p>“I offer my apologies to Mademoiselle la Marquise,”
the man stammered, “but I thought—I felt sure——”</p>

<p>“What you chose to think,” Denise pursued, “can
be no excuse for so insulting a mistake. The Marquise
de Beau Séjour will, however, overlook it for
once, provided that you promise not to repeat the
offence. That will do.”</p>

<p>She turned her back on his fervent avowals and the
man crept from her haughty presence. In five minutes
the court-yard was clear of Madame de Pompadour’s
spies.</p>

<p>Denise had fetched the stranger back. “André,”
she said, “be so good as to conduct this lady yourself
to the barriers. I will wait for you here.”</p>

<p>The girl quietly put on her cloak. “Adieu, Mademoiselle!”
They clasped hands in silence. “Adieu—Denise,”
she whispered. “Adieu for ever!” Without
another word André and she left the room.</p>

<p>When he returned an hour later one glance at his
face told Denise that, whatever had passed in the
journey, he did not know the secret of “No. 101.”
That was still to remain in the keeping of two women
who loved the same man, and it would go with those
two to the grave a secret for ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>FORTUNE’S BANTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur le Vicomte de Nérac</span> waits on Madame
la Marquise,” said the gentleman-usher.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour glanced at the clock. As
André bowed it began to strike ten distinctly.</p>

<p>“You are punctual, Vicomte, and a man of your
word,” the lady said with a faint smile.</p>

<p>André bowed again. What a contrast! The salon
was as gay and refined as it had been a week ago. All
traces of disorder had vanished and Madame herself in
her heliotrope silk was as divinely seductive, as fresh
and unconquerable, as when she had captivated Paris
and the King at the ball of the Hôtel-de-Ville. And
against that vision of loveliness he saw reflected in the
mirror his own grim face, with the haggard eyes and
deep-cut lines round mouth and chin of a man who had
“been in hell” since he last stood in this room.</p>

<p>“You are tired,” Madame said gently. “If you
please—” she wheeled a chair forward. But André
remained standing. “I have to ask your pardon,”
she continued, dropping her eyes. “I am sorry that last
night I used words which I deeply regret using. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
though I cannot ask you, Vicomte, to forget them, I
can and do ask you to forgive.”</p>

<p>André’s hand tightened unconsciously on the back
of the chair. He was here to demand an apology, and
he had been swiftly disarmed by one gentle stroke.</p>

<p>“This is the jewel of the Marquise de Beau Séjour,”
Madame said, “it is useless to me. I return it to you,
unless you prefer I should return it to the Marquise
herself in your presence and repeat what I have tried
to say to you.”</p>

<p>André took the jewel mechanically. An apology
also to Denise! That, too, he had come to extort, and
it was his and hers without the asking. The pastels
on the panelled walls rocked slowly in a blur of the
October sunlight which kissed the heliotrope ribbon on
Madame’s throat.</p>

<p>“You have served me,” she added, “as no man has
ever done or ever will. I was ungrateful and false and
cruel and unjust. Let me atone now.” She had held
out a hand.</p>

<p>A third time André felt that he did not know Madame
de Pompadour; he was learning as some men
can that the heart and thoughts of a woman of genius,
born to conquer a king and subjugate a court, are not
to be fathomed in a few weeks, even by one to whom
many other women have laid bare the mysterious
workings of a woman’s heart.</p>

<p>“I have brought you your despatch, Madame,”
he said, choosing his words slowly, and conscious of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
clumsiness before the ease and tact of this <i>bourgeoise</i>
adventuress.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she took it almost indifferently, but the
flash that turned her eyes from grey to blue, the quick
movement of the locket on her breast, would have revealed
much to another woman. She placed it on the
table beside a tiny heap of torn papers. André recognised
these fragments. They had once been the <i>lettre
de cachet</i> for Denise, which Madame had destroyed before
he came. “Yes,” she said, “though the despatch
is useless now, none the less I thank you from the
bottom of my heart.”</p>

<p>“Useless,” André stammered.</p>

<p>“For two reasons,” she smiled. “The agent from
whom you forced that despatch at the peril of your life
took poison an hour after he was lodged at the Bastille.
You had not heard? Well, the dead tell no embarrassing
tales. Secondly,” she pulled out her watch, “the
Jacobites have already been informed in the King’s
own handwriting that they might have a forgery in my
writing imposed on them, and that information has
already been privately conveyed to the English Government.
The English would not give a sou for the secret
despatch to-day.”</p>

<p>So that was how Madame had spent her night, and
it had left her radiant as Aphrodite rising from the
foam, while he, André, was oppressed by the weariness
of the defeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Marquise de Beau Séjour is safe, you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
safe, Vicomte, and I am safe, and the King is happy
and well. The only persons who are not safe and
happy,” she smiled with the daintiest irony, “are or
will be some of your enemies and mine. My hour has
come. I shall not ask them to forgive, nor will they
forget.”</p>

<p>Had Denise been in the room she would have recalled
the words of the girl whom André had conducted
to the Barrier of St. Louis. This woman was the
destiny of France, against whom men fought in vain.
As it was, Mont Rouge’s letter in his breast pocket
seemed to cry out, and André shivered. Madame de
Pompadour’s triumph was complete.</p>

<p>“No, they will not forget,” Madame continued,
“because they conspired to ruin you, my friend, you
to whom Antoinette de Pompadour will always be
grateful, for when you might have deserted her and
saved yourself you refused. You may not forgive me,
but I can punish them, and I will.”</p>

<p>André impulsively took her hand. “Forget my
words, Madame,” he cried.</p>

<p>“They were forgotten hours ago,” she answered
softly. “I only remember your oath of loyalty and
how nobly you kept it.”</p>

<p>It was the <i>vivandière</i> at Fontenoy who was looking
at him now; nay, rather it was the woman the beating
of whose heart he had heard on the secret stair. Death
alone would silence that beating now.</p>

<p>“See,” she said, “you are again the Captain of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
Queen’s Guards, the King has promised, and you shall
be Minister for War. And,” she unrolled a sheet of
paper, “if you choose, to-morrow in the Galerie des
Glaces they shall know that before long you will be
Marquis de Beau Séjour as well as Vicomte de Nérac.
But neither I nor you can settle that, nor the King,
for kings and men alone,” she laughed gently, “cannot
make a man’s fate.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Madame. His Majesty, I hope, will
know that I am his servant always, but my decision is
already taken, and from to-day I shall not live at Versailles
nor Paris; De Nérac is to be my home, and perhaps
some day Beau Séjour.”</p>

<p>Madame had dropped the roll of paper in an astonishment
she failed to master. Her lips parted as she
looked him in the face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” André repeated. “The Marquise de Beau
Séjour and I have decided. Nothing can alter that
decision.”</p>

<p>“Is it because of me?” she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“No, Marquise. I had made up my mind before I
knew Mademoiselle had made up hers.”</p>

<p>Madame endeavoured to penetrate his motives.
There were mysteries fascinating to a woman, the
wrestlings of the spirit that alter a human soul, to be
read in that handsome face so grey, so tried, yet so
nobly firm. Madame de Pompadour could discover
no more than that a new element, born of spiritual
travail in the night that had passed, had entered into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
André’s life. What it was, whence it came, and why,
baffled her. It is, perhaps, well for women of genius
to learn early that there are gifts of the spirit to a few
men that it is not for a woman to comprehend, just as
there are impulses in a woman that the choicest soul
of man must accept by faith in the acts in which they
find expression.</p>

<p>“Then your ambitions are gone?” she asked, with
that touch of sadness that can quicken sympathy into
inspiration. “You are destined to be great, and,” her
eyes pierced the vision of the future, “I desired to help
to make you great.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” he answered simply, “I have achieved
my greatest ambition, and I believe I can serve my
France better at Beau Séjour than at Versailles.”</p>

<p>She was playing the great game that was her life,
and she was not beaten yet.</p>

<p>“And ‘No. 101’?” she asked gravely.</p>

<p>“There will be treachery, no doubt, in the future,”
André replied, “there may even be a ‘No. 101’; but
the ‘No. 101’ that you and I, Madame, have fought
with will not trouble you again.”</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour studied the speaker’s face,
reflecting on the mysterious confidence in this answer.
The riddle was as puzzling to her to-day as it had
been at Fontenoy. André, she saw, could have told
her much; but she also felt he would never tell. And
it was not the least of her rare gifts instinctively to
recognise when to stop and when to yield. The future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
was her absorbing care always, and the Vicomte de
Nérac would belong to that future.</p>

<p>“You keep your best news to the end,” she said
with graceful gratitude. “Thanks to you, Vicomte, I
hope I have heard the last of ‘No. 101.’ I shall not
forget you at Beau Séjour; do not, in the years to come,
think too harshly of me. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Adieu, Madame,” he raised her fingers to his lips.
“Adieu!”</p>

<p>And as the door closed on him she knew, if “No.
101” had defeated her after all, that whatever the past
had been, whatever the future might bring, she would
never triumph over any man as she had triumphed that
morning over André de Nérac. Nor would he ever
forget the salon of Madame de Pompadour. The spell
of a woman’s genius once cast on any man touched
to the finer issues of human destinies can never be
effaced.</p>

<p>But one thing remained, and it was settled in the
parlour of “The Cock with the Spurs of Gold,” in
which the Comtesse des Forges, the Duc de Pontchartrain,
and the Comte de Mont Rouge, still a prisoner,
unknown to the Court and the King, were waiting for
André.</p>

<p>They had dimly guessed why they had been summoned,
and their bitter fears were confirmed by the
sight of Denise, whom André had brought with
him.</p>

<p>“The Comte de Mont Rouge,” André began without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
ceremony, “was arrested last night by myself. The
reason will be found in these three letters, copies of
which I now give you.”</p>

<p>Denise alone was surprised. André had been given
something at the Barrier of St. Louis after all. The
letters proved to have been written by Mont Rouge,
the Duke, and the Comtesse.</p>

<p>“If I chose,” André continued, “all of you three
might now be in the Bastille, noble though you be.
But the Marquise de Beau Séjour, who has not read
those letters, has asked me to spare you because you
were once her friends. I have agreed.”</p>

<p>“I shall not forget your indulgence, Mademoiselle,”
the Comtesse burst out, beside herself with vindictive
rage.</p>

<p>“Nor will Madame de Pompadour,” André answered
drily. “The originals of those letters are now in her
possession in a sealed envelope. She does not yet
know what they contain; may I hope you will never
make it necessary for her to ask for permission from
the Marquise de Beau Séjour to break that seal? You
may not find either the King or Madame as indulgent
as the lady whom you have wronged.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” said the Duke, after a pause, “the
pleasantest task for a gentleman in life is to confess to
a lady that he has been a fool, when the folly has been
inspired by herself. You will give me that pleasure
now.”</p>

<p>And with his finished smile he had kissed her hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
and bowed himself out of the room. Not so Mont
Rouge.</p>

<p>“You shall give me satisfaction, Vicomte,” he
growled sulkily.</p>

<p>André looked him all over with a quiet scorn.
“Monsieur le Comte,” he said, “the Vicomte de Nérac
does not cross swords with traitors nor with men who
use loaded dice.”</p>

<p>Then he took Denise to her carriage and returned.</p>

<p>“And when your sword arm is healed,” he added,
“two other gentlemen have a prior claim, and I understand
they will both insist on it, the Comte des Forges,”
he bowed to the Comtesse, “and my friend the Vicomte
de St. Benôit, whose name you pledged to an English
traitor without his knowledge, and whom you tricked
into being the accomplice of a card-sharper’s rascality.
I am afraid I shall not have the pleasure of showing
you that for such as you the Vicomte de Nérac does
not use a sword, but his hunting whip.”</p>

<p>And André left him to his fate.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Neither he nor Denise altered their decision. To
Beau Séjour they went, and at Beau Séjour they remained.
Had you visited, as so many travellers then
and since have done, the famous château, two questions
you would certainly have been tempted to ask: To
whom had that noble coat of arms in the great hall
once belonged, a coat not of the Beau Séjour nor of the
De Néracs? And the other would rise to your lips in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
the crypt of the village church, where amidst the nameless
tombs of many who bear the same coat of arms
with the same motto lay a single slab. “François de
St. Amant” is all the name it bears. It has no date,
no heraldic symbol to show why it is there, but at the
foot are cut the familiar words, “<i>Dieu Le Vengeur</i>.”
Nor could any one now or since explain why these
things were so, nor why beside that simple slab lay
for many years another with no inscription on it at all,
a tomb waiting, as it were for some one whom death
had not yet claimed. To the villagers, happier than
any serfs on any demesne in France, these mysteries
were simply the will of Madame la Marquise, nor did
the curious ever succeed in getting a more satisfying
answer.</p>

<p>The villagers were right. It was Denise’s act, and
André, whatever he may have guessed, never asked
why, for of certain events in the past both he and she
were content with the better part of silence. Friends
came to them from Paris and Versailles; they heard of
all that was being done at the Court, of the unshaken
supremacy of Madame de Pompadour; they lived
through the years of hollow truce that followed the
war of Fontenoy, through the terrible humiliation of
the Seven Years’ War that followed the hollow truce,
through the sombre and bleak tragedies of misery, disgrace,
and starvation, defeat on sea and land for their
France. Once only did they go together to Paris, in
1768, to attend the funeral of Queen Marie Leczinska.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
And once only before then André had been summoned
alone to Versailles, to say good-bye to the dying Madame
de Pompadour, to find her a wasted skeleton, her
face a pitiful wreck of the beauty which twenty years
before had stormed the privileged citadel of royalty and
the <i>noblesse</i>, but a woman in whom the spirit and the
wit that had dominated France were unquenched and
unquenchable.</p>

<p>Nor did André ever again forget that April day with
its chilling rain. He stood at the windows of the
Palace, where, if you will, you can stand to-day, and
watched the cortège that carried the last remains of the
Marquise de Pompadour from the Cour d’Honneur into
the Place d’Armes and down the Avenue de Paris
to the magnificent sepulchre that had been prepared in
the Church of the Capuchins in the Place Vendôme
for the Mistress of France.</p>

<p>To one who had heard the crystal-gazer’s prediction,
and had lived through these twenty years, there was
more than a sermon in the King’s heartless comment
as he, too, eyed the long procession wind away in the
drenching squalls.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, “has a cold day for her journey.”
That was all.</p>

<p>And Queen Marie did not exaggerate when she
wrote, “She is forgotten as if she had never existed.
Such is the way of the world.” What a world is this,
and how does Fortune banter us! as a greater person
than Queen Marie remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>When André returned to his château from that
melancholy visit, Denise asked no questions, not even
about the new ring he wore, with a crest she knew and
the historic motto, “<i>Discret et Fidèle</i>.” Versailles and
Fontenoy alike belonged to a buried past.</p>

<p>Still less had either reason or wish to witness the
degradation of the Palace of Louis Quatorze by Madame
du Barry, under the grandson for whose death the
nation that had once called him “Louis the Well-Beloved”
now prayed. With the accession of Louis XVI.
and Marie Antoinette they both believed that the night
of bankruptcy and shame had at last passed, and death
in his mercy took them away before the belief could be
shattered, before the silver trumpets of the nobles of
the Chevau-légers de la Garde de la Maison du Roi,
that had blown for the monarchy of France on so many
stricken fields, were silenced by the tumbrils of the Conciergerie
for ever. Perhaps they were happier in their
ignorance than those whose footsteps to-day so inquisitively
mock the proud silence of the Galerie des Glaces,
whose voices scare the ghostly echoes in the loneliness
of what was once the salon of Madame de Pompadour;
for these are reminded at every turn that in the new
France, Versailles, once the emblem of a nation’s greatness,
is now only a museum of pictures; that if it has a
history for the French children playing on the terrace
it is because it is a tomb of bitter memories, of blood
shed not only by the hand of an alien foe, of the disaster
that cries out for a nation’s revenge, but is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
blessed with the heritage of a people’s love, still less
has the right to ask for a people’s tears.</p>

<p>This latest story by the author of <i>The Jessamy

ideal love affair in the romantic life of Lord
Byron. The story opens during the poet’s
boyhood and tells of his early devotion to
his cousin, Mary Chaworth. Mr. Moore has
followed history very closely, and his descriptions
of London society when Byron was the
rage are as accurate as they are dramatic.
Lady Caroline Lamb figures prominently in
the story, but the heroine continues to be
Byron’s early love, Mary Chaworth. His attachment
for his cousin was the strongest and
most enduring of his life, and it failed of realization
only by the narrowest of chances.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
